The most frequently used botanical drugs in the RCTs were the following six: A. sinensis (Oliv.) Diels [Apiaceae; Angelica Sinensis Radix], E. brevicornu Maxim. [Berberidaceae; Epimedii Herba], C. barometz (L.). J.Sm. [Cyatheaceae; Cibotii Rhizoma], G. macrophylla Pall. [Gentianaceae; Gentianae Macrophyllae Radix], A. mongholicus Bunge [Fabaceae; Astragali Radix], and A. carmichaelii Debeaux [Ranunculaceae; Aconiti Lateralis Radix Preparata] (Table 3). These botanical drugs have been reported to have anti-osteoporotic effects. Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels has been reported to have anti-osteoporotic effects by reducing CTX-I and osteocalcin (Lim and Kim, 2014), whereas C. barometz (L.) J.Sm. Was reported to have anti-osteoporotic effects by reducing RANKL (Kim et al., 2007). In particular, G. macrophylla Pall. and E. brevicornu Maxim. Have been reported to have excellent anti-osteoporosis and anti-inflammatory effects. Gentiana macrophylla Pall. Inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, and COX-2 (Wang et al., 2013), and reduces the differentiation of RANKL-induced osteoclasts and the expression of Nucleic Factor Kappa B (Yang et al., 2020). Moreover, Icarin, the main ingredient of E. brevicornu Maxim., has been reported to reduce COX and inflammatory mediators, such as COX-2 and iNOS, as well as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α (Zhang et al., 2022). Therefore, these botanical drugs may be considered for clinical treatment of secondary osteoporosis in patients with RA in the future.
