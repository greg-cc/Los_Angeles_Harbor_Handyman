TI  - Bu Yang Huan Wu Prevents Osteogenic Effect of Muscle-Derived Stromal Cells via 
      Regulating JAK/STAT Pathway.

AB  - Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a crucial pathological process in which bone or 
      calcification develop in skeletal muscle and surrounding soft tissues. 
      Muscle-derived stromal cells (MDSC) are important muscle-resident mesenchymal 
      progenitor cells and macrophage-derived oncostatin M (OSM) can induce osteogenic 
      differentiation. Bu Yang Huan Wu (BYHW), which has a long history of use in 
      restraining inflammation, can prevent osteogenic differentiation and HO formation 
      while underlying mechanism is still unclear. The Janus kinase/signal transducer 
      and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway is an important 
      pathway to regulate osteogenic differentiation of related cells. In this study, 
      we investigated whether BYHW could inhibit osteogenesis effect of MDSC through 
      OSM mediated by macrophages, and whether JAK/STAT pathway regulated this 
      biological process. We found that activated macrophages promoted osteogenic 
      differentiation of MDSC through OSM and BYHW could decrease the level of OSM and 
      osteogenic activity of MDSC. Further, we confirmed the regulatory effect of 
      JAK/STAT pathway, blocking this pathway could suppress the level of OSM and 
      osteogenic differentiation of MDSC. We showed that BYHW could suppress osteogenic 
      differentiation of MDSC through JAK/STAT signalling. These findings expand the 
      application scope of traditional Chinese medicine and provide a basis for the 
      further investigation of the potential therapeutic role of HO.

TI  - Exploration of the Mechanisms of Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu Decoction in the Treatment of 
      Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy by Integrating of Serum Pharmacochemistry and 
      Network Pharmacology.
PG  - e202400910
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.202400910 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a significant and frequent complication 
      of diabetes. Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu Decoction (BHD) is a classic traditional Chinese 
      herbal prescription that is commonly used in modern clinical practice for the 
      effective treatment of DPN, but the underlying mechanism is not yet clearly 
      defined. The chemical constituents of BHD were characterized by UPLC-Q-Orbitrap 
      HR MS/MS, and a total of 101 chemical components were identified, including 30 
      components absorbed into blood. An interaction network of 
      "compound-target-disease" interactions was constructed based on the compounds 
      detected absorbed in blood and their corresponding targets of diabetic neuropathy 
      acquired from disease gene databases, and the possible biological targets and 
      potential signalling pathways of BHD were predicted via network pharmacology 
      analysis. Subsequently, methylglyoxal-induced (MGO-induced) Schwann cells (SCs) 
      were used to identify the active ingredients in blood components of BHD and 
      verify the molecular mechanisms of BHD. Through network topological analysis, 30 
      shared targets strongly implicated in the anti-DPN effects of BHD were identifed. 
      Combined network pharmacology and in vitro cellular analysis, we found that the 
      active ingredient of BHD may treat DPN by modulating the AGEs/RAGE pathway. This 
      study provides valuable evidence for future mechanistic studies and potential 
      therapeutic applications for patients with DPN.

TI  - The effects of Bu Yang Huan Wu Tang on post-stroke epilepsy: a nationwide matched 
      study.
PG  - 1839-1850
LID - 10.2147/CLEP.S175677 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term risk of epilepsy in stroke patients who use 
      Bu Yang Huan Wu Tang (BYHWT) and those who do not. METHODS: In the Taiwanese 
      national insurance claims data, we identified newly diagnosed stroke patients 
      receiving inpatient care in the years 2000-2004. Using propensity score-matched 
      pairs to balance the baseline characteristics, we selected eligible stroke 
      patients who did (n=8,971) and did not (n=8,971) receive BYHWT. These two groups 
      were followed up until the end of 2009 to track the occurrence of epilepsy. We 
      used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate the adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for 
      post-stroke epilepsy during the follow-up period according to BYHWT use. RESULTS: 
      Compared with the control group, stroke patients with BYHWT had a reduced risk of 
      epilepsy during the 5-9 years of the follow-up period (HR 0.69, 95% CI 
      0.61-0.77). The association between BYHWT and reduced post-stroke epilepsy was 
      significant in various subgroups of stroke patients. There was a dose-dependent 
      decrease in the frequency of epilepsy with increasing quantities of BYHWT use 
      from 1 package (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.90) to ≥6 packages (HR 0.52, 95% CI 
      0.42-0.65). CONCLUSION: Stroke patients who received BYHWT therapy had a reduced 
      long-term risk of epilepsy, and the beneficial effect could be observed in 
      various subgroups. However, future clinical trials will be necessary to 
      corroborate the present findings and identify the biochemical mechanism involved.

      Possible role in protecting against Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia.
PG  - 1854-1863
LID - 10.7150/ijms.46581 [doi]
AB  - Bu Yang Huan Wu decoction (BYHW) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that 
      consists of several herbs and has been used in patients with ischemic stroke for 
      centuries. Although powdered formula of BYHW has widely been prescribed in clinic 
      nowadays, evidence-based effectiveness and mechanism of action of BYHW powdered 
      product in stroke remain to be characterized. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
      subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min followed by 
      reperfusion for 24 h (ischemia/reperfusion; I/R) or sham surgery. After I/R, the 
      rats were then given low dose (0.5 g/kg) and high dose (2.5 g/kg) of BYHW or 
      vehicle by oral gavage twice a day for seven consecutive days. The results showed 
      that I/R induced obvious cerebral infarction and neurobehavioral defects, in 
      parallel with histological aberrations and extensive signaling of proinflammatory 
      cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in 
      the stroke model. Post-I/R treatment with BYHW powdered product significantly 
      reduced the infarct area and ameliorated neurofunctional defects in a 
      dose-dependent manner. The dose dependence was associated with TNF-α 
      downregulation and interleukin-10 (IL-10) induction. In summary, the present 
      findings demonstrated that BYHW powdered product exhibited therapeutic efficacy 
      for experimental stroke and a higher dose treatment may strengthen the 
      effectiveness via inflammatory modulation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of Bu Yang Huan Wu Decoction on astrocytes after 
      cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. METHOD: Cerebral ischemia model in gerbils was 
      produced by ligating bilateral common carotid artery. The dynamic expressin of 
      GFAP were determined by immunochemistry after cerebyal ischemia for 15 min 
      followed by reperfusion for 24 hours and 48 hours. RESULT: GFAP positive 
      reactions reached a peak after cerebral ischemia for 15 min followed by 
      reperfusion for 24 hours. Bu Yang Huan Wu Decoction decreased the expression. 
      GFAP positive reactions decreased after cerebral ischemia for 15 min followed by 
      reperfusion for 48 hours, Bu Yang Huan Wu Decoction increased the expression. 
      CONCLUSION: The regulation of Bu Yang Huan Wu Decoction on astrocytes after 
      cerebral ischemia and reperfusion may be related to repairing process after 
      cerebral ischemia.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bu Yang Huan Wu Decoction (BYHW) is a famous 
      traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula used in China for the treatment of 
      cerebral ischemic stroke. But the protective effects and underlining mechanisms 
      of BYHW remain unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was designed to investigate 
      the protective effects and underlining signaling mechanisms of BYHW on brain 
      tissues in a rat model of cerebral ischemic reperfusion (I/R) injury. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Liquid chromatography was used to verify the composition of BYHW. 
      The cerebral edema and infarct volume were measured by magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI). The morphology and ultrastructure of ischemic penumbra brain tissues were 
      observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
      The expression levels of HIF-1 α, VEGF and β-ENaC were tested using 
      immunohistochemistry technique, western blot and quantitative PCR analysis, 
      respectively. RESULTS: Administration of BYHW significantly decreased cerebral 
      edema, rat neurological function scores, reduced brain infarct volume. At the 
      same time, BYHW had protective effect on the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which 
      improved the morphology and ultrastructure of ischemic penumbra brain tissues. 
      BYHW treatment significantly decreased the protein and mRNA levels of HIF-1 α and 
      VEGF compared with the model treatment. In addition, BYHW treatment significantly 
      up-regulated the protein and mRNA levels of β-ENaC. CONCLUSIONS: BYHW protected 
      against cerebral I/R injury in MCAO rats through inhibiting the activation of the 
      HIF-1 α /VEGF pathway and stabilizing ion channel of β-ENaC in brain, indicating 
      that BYHW shows potential for stroke treatment in acute stage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The utilization of traditional Chinese medicine is a common 
      therapeutic approach for stroke patients in Chinese population, but little is 
      known about the effect of Bu Yang Huan Wu Tang (BYHWT) on post-stroke diabetes. 
      PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the risk of diabetes in stroke patients who used 
      BYHWT. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study based on a real-world database 
      was conducted. METHODS: Newly diagnosed stroke patients receiving inpatient care 
      from 2000 to 2004 were identified using a large-scale insurance database in 
      Taiwan. Propensity score matching was used to select eligible stroke patients who 
      did (n = 9849) and did not (n = 9849) receive BYHWT. These two groups were 
      followed up until the end of 2009 to track incident diabetes. Cox proportional 
      hazard models were used to calculate the adjusted hazard rations (HRs) and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CIs) for post-stroke diabetes associated with BYHWT during 
      the follow-up period. RESULTS: Stroke patients who used BYHWT had a reduced 
      incidence of diabetes (14.1% vs. 19.0%, p < 0.0001) and reduced risk of diabetes 
      (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.83) compared with the control group. The association 
      between BYHWT and reduced risk of post-stroke diabetes was significant across 
      sexe, age group, and stroke subtype. Additionally, the use of BYHWT was 
      associated with a reduced risk of post-stroke diabetes even after excluding the 
      initial three months of diabetes cases in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Stroke patients who received BYHWT therapy had a reduced risk of diabetes, and a 
      positive effect was observed in various subgroups. However, future clinical 
      trials will be necessary to validate the present findings and identify the 
      biochemical mechanism involved.

      with diabetic pulmonary fibrosis via regulating oxidative stress and lipid 
      metabolism disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus type 2 and pulmonary fibrosis have been found to be 
      closely related in clinical practice. Diabetic pulmonary fibrosis (DPF) is a 
      complication of diabetes mellitus, but its treatment has yet to be thoroughly 
      investigated. Bu Yang Huan Wu Decoction (BYHWD) is a well-known traditional 
      Chinese prescription that has shown great efficacy in treating pulmonary fibrosis 
      with hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects. METHODS: The active ingredients of 
      BYHWD and the corresponding targets were retrieved from the Traditional Chinese 
      Medicine Systematic Pharmacology Database (TCMSP) and SymMap2. Disease-related 
      targets were obtained from the GeneCard, OMIM and CTD databases. GO enrichment 
      and KEGG pathway enrichment were carried out using the DAVID database. AutoDock 
      Vina software was employed to perform molecular docking. Molecular dynamics 
      simulations of proteinligand complexes were conducted by Gromacs. Animal 
      experiments were further performed to validate the effects of BYHWD on the 
      selected core targets, markers of oxidative stress, serum lipids, blood glucose 
      and pulmonary fibrosis. RESULTS: A total of 84 active ingredients and 830 target 
      genes were screened in BYHWD, among which 56 target genes intersected with 
      DPF-related targets. Network pharmacological analysis revealed that the active 
      ingredients can regulate target genes such as IL-6, TNF-α, VEGFA and CASP3, 
      mainly through AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway and TNF 
      signaling pathway. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggested 
      that IL6-astragaloside IV, IL6-baicalein, TNFα-astragaloside IV, and 
      TNFα-baicalein docking complexes could bind stably. Animal experiments showed 
      that BYHWD could reduce the expression of core targets such as VEGFA, CASP3, IL-6 
      and TNF-α. In addition, BYHWD could reduce blood glucose, lipid, and MDA levels 
      in DPF while increasing the activities of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px. BYHWD attenuated 
      the expression of HYP and collagen I, mitigating pathological damage and collagen 
      deposition within lung tissue. CONCLUSIONS: BYHWD modulates lipid metabolism 
      disorders and oxidative stress by targeting the core targets of IL6, TNF-α, VEGFA 
      and CASP3 through the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, making it a potential therapy 
      for DPF.

AB  - Articular cartilage deterioration is a hallmark of osteoarthritis (OA). Articular 
      cartilage is structurally destroyed as a result of mechanical, metabolic, and 
      inflammatory factors that are part of the etiology of OA. Although the precise 
      molecular processes in OA are still unclear, the hypoxic microenvironment is 
      crucial. For the clinical therapy of orthopedic illnesses, particularly OA, the 
      Bu Yang Huan Wu Decoction (BYHWD) is frequently utilized, however, the precise 
      pharmacological mechanism behind its action is unclear. With the use of 
      transcriptome and network pharmacology, we want to understand the molecular 
      mechanisms behind OA and the pharmacological mechanism of BYHWD for OA treatment. 
      The traditional Chinese medicine database and incoming blood component data were 
      used to assess the therapeutic components and targets of action of BYHWD, while 
      the transcriptome data was used to analyze the critical targets and possible 
      immunological and inflammatory mechanisms of OA occurrence. Using gene ontology 
      and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes, additional research was conducted 
      based on the network pharmacological analysis to determine the biological 
      mechanism of BYHWD for treating OA. Eight active components of BYHWD were found 
      by drug screening, astragaloside, kaempferol, formononetin, and paeoniflorin may 
      be significant players. The HIF-1/VEGF signaling way, EGFR tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor resistance, and Rap1 signaling pathway are the primary biological 
      processes involved in BYHWD treatment OA. BYHWD reduces synovitis by taking part 
      in HIF-1/VEGF signaling, which controls immune and inflammatory factors through 
      important components like formononetin, kaempferol, paeoniflorin, astragaloside, 
      etc. This offers a fresh perspective on treating OA and applying traditional 
      Chinese medicine.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of Bushen Huoxue Fang (BSHXF, a 
      traditional Chinese medicine formula) for improving recurrent spontaneous 
      abortion (RSA) in mice and the role of tyrosine kinase (JAK2) and transcriptional 
      activator (STAT3) signaling pathway in its therapeutic mechanism. METHODS: Female 
      CBA/J mice were caged with male DBA/2 mice to establish RSA mouse models, which 
      were randomly divided into model group, dydrogesterone group and BSHXF group, 
      with the female mice caged with male BALB/c mice as the control group (n=6). From 
      the first day of pregnancy, the mice were subjected to daily intragastric 
      administration of BSHXF, dydrogesterone, or distilled water (in control and model 
      groups) for 12 days. After the treatments, serum levels of antithrombin III 
      (AT-III), activated protein C (APC), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), 
      progesterone, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), and estradiol (E2) were 
      detected in each group using ELISA. HE staining was used to observe the 
      morphological changes of the endometrium of the mice. Western blotting was 
      performed to determine the expressions of p-JAK2, p-Stat3 and Bcl-2 in the 
      placenta of the mice. RESULTS: Compared with the control mice, the mouse models 
      of RSA showed a significantly increased embryo loss rate with decreased serum 
      levels of AT-III, T-PA, progesterone, APC and HCG, increased placental 
      expressions of p-JAK2, p-STAT3 and Bax, and decreased expression of Bcl-2 (P < 
      0.05). Treatments with BSHXF and dydrogesterone both increased serum levels of 
      AT-III, t-PA and HCG in the mouse models; Serum APC level was significantly 
      reduced in BSHXF group and serum progesterone level was significantly increased 
      in dydrogesterone group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: BSHXF can improve the 
      prethrombotic state and inhibit cell apoptosis by downregulating the JAK2/STAT3 
      pathway to increase the pregnancy rate in mouse models of RSA.

TI  - Bu-Yang decoction attenuates OVX-induced sarcopenia by upregulating CXCR4 to 
      suppress GPX4-mediated ferroptosis.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Buyang Decoction (BYD), a traditional Chinese 
      medicine formula, has demonstrated potential in strengthening muscles and bones, 
      but its role in sarcopenia (SP) remains unclear. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent 
      form of regulated cell death triggered by lipid peroxidation, which plays a key 
      role in the development of SP. PURPOSE: This study investigated whether BYD 
      alleviates SP by modulating ferroptosis via the CXCR4-GPX4 signaling axis. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: OVX was used to model SP in vivo, with BYD administered at 
      different concentrations. Therapeutic effects were assessed using behavioral 
      tests, histochemistry, qRT-PCR, TEM, MRI, and micro-CT. In vitro, Erastin was 
      used as an intervention, and techniques including WB, qRT-PCR, Nile red staining, 
      DAFH-DA staining, and immunofluorescence were employed. GEO database analysis 
      identified CXCR4 as a key gene. CXCR4 inhibition was performed pharmacologically 
      in vivo and genetically in vitro. RESULTS: In vivo, BYD enhanced muscle strength, 
      differentiation, and GPX4 expression while reducing oxidative stress. In vitro, 
      BYD promoted MuSCs (Muscle Satellite Cells) proliferation and differentiation 
      while lowering oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In both in vivo and in 
      vitro studies, CXCR4 inhibition resulted in the loss of BYD's therapeutic 
      effects. CONCLUSION: BYD mitigates SP by inhibiting ferroptosis via 
      CXCR4-mediated GPX4 upregulation, highlighting CXCR4 as a potential therapeutic 
      target.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Bushenhuoxue formula (BSHXF) is successfully used as a 
      non-traumatic therapy in treating bone fracture in China, the molecular mechanism 
      underlying its effects remains poorly understood. PURPOSE: The present study aims 
      to explore the therapeutic effects of BSHXF on fracture healing in mice and the 
      underlying mechanism. METHODS: We performed unilateral open transverse tibial 
      fracture procedure in C57BL/6 mice which were treated with or without BSHXF. 
      Fracture callus tissues were collected and analyzed by X-ray, micro-CT, 
      biomechanical testing, histopathology and quantitative gene expression analysis. 
      Tibial fracture procedure was also performed in Cre-negative and Gli1-CreER; 
      Tgfbr2flox/flox conditional knockout (KO) mice (Tgfbr2(Gli1ER)) to determine if 
      BSHXF enhances fracture healing in a TGF-β-dependent manner. In addition, 
      scratch-wound assay and cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay were used to evaluate 
      the effect of BSHXF on cell migration and cell proliferation in C3H10T1/2 
      mesenchymal stem cells, respectively. RESULTS: BSHXF promoted endochondral 
      ossification and enhanced bone strength in wild-type (WT) or Cre- control mice. 
      In contrast, BSHXF failed to promote bone fracture healing in Tgfbr2(Gli1ER) 
      conditional KO mice. In the mice receiving BSHXF treatment, TGF-β/Smad2 signaling 
      was significantly activated. Moreover, BSHXF enhanced cell migration and cell 
      proliferation in C3H10T1/2 cells, which was strongly attenuated by the small 
      molecule inhibitor SB525334 against TGF-β type I receptor. CONCLUSION: These data 
      demonstrated that BSHXF promotes fracture healing by activating TGF-β/Smad2 
      signaling. BSHXF may be used as a type of alternative medicine for the treatment 
      of bone fracture healing.

      integrative neurofunctional and genomic approach in ischemic stroke mice.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bu-yang Huan-wu decoction (BHD) is a famous 
      traditional Chinese medicine formula that has been used clinically in Asia to 
      treat stroke-induced disability for centuries, but the underlying neuroprotective 
      mechanisms are not fully understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we aim to 
      investigate the mechanisms of action using an integrative neurofunctional and 
      broad genomics approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male ICR mice were subjected to 
      an acute ischemic stroke by inducing a middle cerebral ischemic/reperfusion 
      (CI/R) injury. To examine whether BHD could extend the lifespan of mice with a 
      stroke, we used oral administration of BHD (0.5 and 1.0g/kg) twice daily starting 
      from 2h after ischemia and compared this with vehicle control treatments, 
      recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA, 10mg/kg, i.v.), and MK-801 
      (0.2mg/kg, i.p.). An integrative neurofunctional and genomic approach was 
      performed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of BHD. RESULTS: More 
      than 80% of the mice died within 2 days after stroke induction in the vehicle 
      control treatment group. However, the survival rates and life-spans of mice 
      treated with BHD, rt-PA and MK-801 were significantly enhanced as compared to the 
      vehicle-treated CI/R group in all three cases. Mice treated with BHD (1.0g/kg) 
      showed the greatest protective effect across all groups. BHD successfully 
      restored brain function, ameliorated the cerebral infarction, and significantly 
      improved the neurological deficits of the mice with a stroke. BHD also reduced 
      inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, as well as improved neurogenesis. 
      The molecular impacts of BHD were assessed by genome-wide transcriptome analysis 
      using brains from the CI/R mice. The results showed a total of 377 
      ischemia-induced probe-sets that were significantly influenced by BHD including 
      93 probe-sets that were commonly more abundant in BHD-treated and sham mice, and 
      another 284 ischemia-induced probe sets that were suppressed by BHD. Mining the 
      functional modules and genetic networks of these 377 genes revealed a significant 
      upregulation of neuroprotective genes associated with neurogenesis (6 genes) and 
      nervous system development (9 genes), and a significant down-regulation of 
      destructive genes associated with the induction of inflammation (14 genes), 
      apoptosis (15 genes), angiogenesis (11 genes) and blood coagulation (7 genes) by 
      BHD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that BHD is able to protect mice against 
      stroke and extend lifespan primarily through a significant down-regulation of 
      genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and blood coagulation, as 
      well as an up-regulation of genes mediating neurogenesis and nervous system 
      development. The changes in expression after treatment with BHD are beneficial 
      after ischemic stroke.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bushenhuoxue formula (BSHXF) has shown excellent clinical effects on 
      the treatment of osteoporosis in China. The aim of this study is to determine the 
      anti-osteoporosis effects and precise molecular mechanisms of BSHXF on mouse 
      models. METHODS: Ten-week-old female C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to ovariectomy 
      and provided a daily treatment of BSHXF. At 8 weeks post-surgery, the femurs were 
      harvested for tissue analyses including μCT, histology, qRT-PCR and 
      immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of β-catenin, ALP and FABP4. To investigate 
      the role of β-catenin in the anti-osteoporosis effects of BSHXF, relative 
      experiments mentioned above were performed in β-catenin conditional knockout 
      mice. RESULTS: Ovariectomized (OVX) mice presented severe bone loss and excessive 
      fat accumulation in the chondro-osseous junction underneath the growth plate, 
      with decreased expression of ALP and increased expression of FABP4. BSHXF 
      significantly recovered the OVX-induced abnormal osteogenesis and adipogenesis 
      with the activation of β-catenin in growth plate chondrocytes. Further, we 
      generated growth plate chondrocyte-specific β-catenin knockout 
      (β-catenin(Gli1ER)) mice that exhibited bone loss and fat accumulation in the 
      chondro-osseous junction, similar to the OVX mice. However, BSHXF failed to 
      rescue the osteoporosis-like phenotype in β-catenin(Gli1ER) mice, indicating the 
      anti-osteoporosis effects of BSHXF act mainly through β-catenin signaling. No 
      significant restoration of ALP and FABP4 was observed in β-catenin(Gli1ER) mice 
      after the treatment of BSHXF. CONCLUSIONS: BSHXF attenuates osteoporosis by 
      promoting osteogenic differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes mainly in 
      β-catenin-dependent manner. BSHXF is considered as a new candidate for the 
      treatment of osteoporosis.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Lower back pain (LBP) is a common and frequent 
      clinical condition, and intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is recognized as 
      the leading cause of LBP, typically manifested by increased nucleus pulposus cell 
      (NPC) senescence and death. In recent years, the treatment of IDD with stem cell 
      injections has had great potential compared to surgical treatment. Combining the 
      two may achieve better results, as BuShenHuoXueFang (BSHXF) is an herbal formula 
      that improves the survival rate of transplanted stem cells and enhances their 
      efficacy. AIM OF THE STUDY: We aimed to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze 
      BSHXF-medicated serum and investigate the molecular mechanism of BSHXF-mediated 
      serum in promoting the differentiation of adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) 
      into NPCs and delaying the senescence of NPCs by regulating the TGF-β1/Smad 
      pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, an ultrahigh-performance liquid 
      chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was 
      used to establish a method for the analysis of rat serum samples to track the 
      active components in vivo; the oxidative damage model of NPCs was induced by 
      T-BHP, and a Transwell chamber was used to construct a coculture system of ADSCs 
      and NPCs. Flow cytometry was used to determine the cell cycle; SA-β-Gal staining 
      was used to assess cell senescence; ELISA was used to detect IL-1β, IL-6 
      inflammatory factors, CXCL-1, CXCL-3, CXCL-10 chemokines, and TGF-β1 in the 
      supernatants of ADSCs and NPCs. WB was used to detect COL2A1, COL1A1, and 
      Aggrecan in ADSCs to assess the manifestation of NP differentiation in ADSCs, and 
      the WB method was used to detect COL2A1, COL1A1, Aggrecan, p16, p21, p53, and 
      p-p53 protein expression in NPCs to reflect the cellular senescence status and to 
      detect TGF-β1, Smad2, Smad3, p- Smad2, and p- Smad3 protein expression in NPCs to 
      reflect the pathway condition. RESULTS: We finally identified 70 blood components 
      and their metabolites, including 38 prototypes, from the BSHXF-medicated serum. 
      Compared with that in the nonmedicated serum group, the TGF-β1/Smad pathway was 
      activated in the medicated serum group, ADSCs moved toward NPC characteristics, 
      the number of NPCs in the S/G2M phase increased, the number of senescent NPCs 
      decreased, IL-1β and IL-6 inflammatory factors in the Transwell decreased, 
      CXCL-1, CXCL-3, and CXCL-10 chemokines decreased, and the expression of p16, p21, 
      p53 and p-p53 proteins in NPCs was inhibited. CONCLUSION: By regulating the 
      TGF-β1/Smad pathway, BSHXF-medicated serum promoted ADSCs to NPCs, effectively 
      alleviated the cycle blockage of NPCs after oxidative damage, encouraged the 
      growth and proliferation of NPCs, delayed the aging of NPCs, improved the 
      deteriorating microenvironment around NPCs, and repaired oxidatively damaged 
      NPCs. The combination of BSHXF or its compounds with ADSCs has great potential 
      for the treatment of IDD in the future.

TI  - Bushen Huoxue Formula Inhibits IL-1β-Induced Apoptosis and Extracellular Matrix 
      Degradation in the Nucleus Pulposus Cells and Improves Intervertebral Disc 
      Degeneration in Rats.
PG  - 121-136
LID - 10.2147/JIR.S431609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The method of action of Bushen Formula (BSHXF) in the treatment of 
      intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) was uncovered in this work using in vivo 
      and in vitro tests. To clarify the mechanism of action of BSHXF, we validated the 
      rat intervertebral disc degeneration model and the nucleus pulposus cell 
      degeneration model. METHODS: In an in vivo model of IVDD the study explores the 
      impact of BSHXF on mitochondrial function, pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
      pro-apoptotic factors, and matrix metalloproteinases. Additionally, it evaluates 
      the induced degeneration of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells in an in vitro model 
      stimulated by interleukin-1 β (IL-1β). The study measures the effects of BSHXF on 
      both the inflammatory response and mitochondrial function. RESULTS: The MRI 
      results showed that BSHXF reduced intervertebral disc volume reduction and 
      degradation of NP tissue. HE, SO-FG and immunofluorescence further confirmed the 
      protective effect of BSHXF on degenerative intervertebral discs. BSHXF reduced 
      the inflammatory levels of IL-6 IL-1β and TNF-α in degenerative intervertebral 
      disc tissue. Meanwhile, JC-1, mPTP and ROS detection revealed that BSHXF can 
      restore mitochondrial function by regulating the expression of antioxidant 
      proteins, playing a protective role in NP cells. Finally, the WB results showed 
      that BSHXF can alleviate IL-1β mediate the degeneration of NP cells. BSHXF can 
      alleviate NP cell apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of bax, cleaved 
      caspase-3, caspase-3, and cyt-c, and increasing the expression of Bcl-2. 
      CONCLUSION: This study reveals that BSHXF inhibits the development of 
      inflammatory factors, which may play a significant role in intervertebral disc 
      degeneration. This implies that BSHXF is a suitable herbal medication for future 
      research into inflammatory cytokine treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore whether Bushen Huoxue Formula (BSHXF) improves the 
      angiogenesis ability of transplanted endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in 
      endplate and its potential mechanism in delaying intervertebral disc degeneration 
      (IDD). METHODS: BSHXF was analyzed via Ultra-High Performance Liquid 
      Chromatography (UPLC). Rabbit axial compression lumbar IDD models were 
      constructed and the effects of BSHXF, EPCs, and their combination in IDD were 
      determined by MRI, histological evaluation, TUNEL, and immunofluorescence assays. 
      Additionally, CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and tube formation assay were used to 
      evaluate EPCs viability, proliferation, cell cycle and the angiogenesis ability 
      of EPCs between groups. RESULTS: BSHXF and transplanted EPCs both attenuate the 
      process of IDD in the rabbit model assessed by MRI, HE staining and Masson 
      staining. TUNEL-positive NP cells were significantly reduced in the BSHXF group, 
      EPCs group, and EPC + BSHXF group compared to the model group (P < 0.05), with 
      the EPC + BSHXF group showing the most significant therapeutic effect. 
      Immunofluorescence detection showed that VEGF, CD34 expression and quantity of 
      microvessels in the endplate significantly increased in the EPC + BSHXF group 
      compared to all the other groups (P < 0.05). Besides, the CCK-8 assay showed an 
      upregulation of EPC viability and the tube formation assay demonstrated a 
      significant increase in tube length and branching in EPCs cultured with 
      BSHXF-containing serum (P < 0.05). Furthermore, BSHXF-containing serum increased 
      VEGF expression in EPCs cultured in vitro (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both BSHXF and 
      EPCs transplantation play an important role in increasing endplate angiogenesis 
      and attenuating IDD. BSHXF can enhance the viability and tube-forming ability of 
      EPCs and endplate microcirculation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Articular cartilage degeneration plays a key role in the pathogenesis 
      of osteoarthritis (OA). Bushenhuoxue formula (BSHXF) has been widely used in the 
      treatment of OA in clinics. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the 
      chondroprotective effect of BSHXF remain to be elucidated. The purpose of this 
      study was to explore the effects of BSHXF on OA mice model. METHODS: In this 
      study, we investigated the effects of BSHXF on destabilization of the medial 
      meniscus (DMM)-induced chondrocyte degradation in OA mice model. At 12 weeks 
      post-surgery, the joints were harvested for tissue analyses, including histology, 
      histomorphometry, TUNEL, OARSI scoring, micro-CT and immunohistochemistry for 
      COL2, TGFBR2, pSMAD2 and MMP13. Additionally, we also evaluated the effects of 
      BSHXF on Mmp13 mRNA and protein expression in chondrogenic ATDC5 cells through 
      real-time PCR and Western blot respectively. Moreover, we investigated the 
      chondroprotective effect of BSHXF on mice with Tgfbr2 conditional knockout 
      (Tgfbr2 (Col2ER) mice) in chondrocyte, including the relative experiments 
      mentioned above. We transfected Tgfbr2 siRNA in ATDC5 to further evaluate the 
      changes of Mmp13 mRNA and protein expression followed by BSHXF treatment. 
      RESULTS: Amelioration of cartilage degradation and chondrocyte apoptosis were 
      observed in DMM-induced mice, with increases in cartilage area and thickness, 
      proteoglycan matrix, COL2 content and decreases in OARSI score at 12 weeks post 
      surgery. Moreover, the elevated TGFBR2 and pSMAD2, and reduced MMP13 positive 
      cells were also revealed in DMM-induced mice treated with BSHXF. Besides, 
      decreased Mmp13 mRNA and protein expression were observed inchondrogenic ATDC5 
      cells culture in serum containing BSHXF. As expected, Tgfbr2 (Col2ER) mice 
      exhibited significant OA-like phenotype. Interestingly, obvious improvement in 
      articular cartilage structure was still observed in Tgfbr2 (Col2ER) mice after 
      BSHXF treatment via up-regulated pSMAD2 and down-regulated MMP13 expressional 
      levels in articular cartilage. CONCLUSIONS: BSHXF could inhibit cartilage 
      degradation through TGF-β/MMP13 signaling, and be considered a good option for 
      the treatment of OA.

TI  - The Inhibitory Effect of the Active Ingredients in the Bushen Huoxue Formula on 
      the IL-17A Signaling Pathway and Its Alleviating Effect on Osteoarthritis.
PG  - 6505-6527
LID - 10.2147/JIR.S506716 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis (OA) stands as a prevalent degenerative disease 
      worldwide. Despite the demonstrated therapeutic efficacy of the Bushen Huoxue 
      formula (BSHXF) in treating OA, its underlying mechanism remains elusive. Network 
      pharmacology is commonly employed for investigating drug-disease associations and 
      processes. In this study, we employed network pharmacology alongside in vitro and 
      in vivo experiments to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which BSHXF treats 
      OA. METHODS: Based on the TCMSP database, active components of BSHXF were 
      screened, and OA-related targets were retrieved from GeneCard and DisGeNET to 
      construct a "component-target-pathway" network using Cytoscape. Core target 
      functions and pathways (KEGG/GO) were analyzed through STRING and Metascape, 
      while component-target binding affinity was validated via Autodock. For in vitro 
      experiments, an IL-1β-induced chondrocyte inflammation model was established, and 
      key protein expression was detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence. For 
      in vivo experiments, an OA model was created by medial meniscectomy of the knee 
      joint in rats, and therapeutic efficacy was assessed using histological staining 
      and micro-CT. RESULTS: This study screened 89 active ingredients of BSHXF and 
      identified 189 common targets. Network pharmacological analysis revealed luteolin 
      and tanshinone IIA as the most crucial active ingredients in treating OA with 
      BSHXF. The potential mechanisms of action for BSHXF in OA treatment involve 
      inflammation inhibition, immune function regulation, and resistance to oxidative 
      stress, with a significant regulatory role played by the IL-17 signaling pathway. 
      Molecular docking results demonstrated luteolin's strong binding affinity to key 
      targets such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Mmp-9), 
      and IL-6.In vitro experiments demonstrated that BSHXF significantly suppressed 
      IL-1β-induced inflammatory responses in chondrocytes, downregulating IL-17A 
      expression (p < 0.05), reducing the expression of MMP-9 (p < 0.05) and IL-6 (p < 
      0.05), and inhibiting apoptosis. Additionally, in vivo experiments revealed that 
      the high-dose BSHXF group (150 mg/kg) markedly alleviated cartilage damage in OA 
      rats, with OARSI scores significantly decreased compared to the model group (p < 
      0.05). Micro-CT analysis showed that BSHXF inhibited osteophyte formation and 
      ameliorated OA pathological conditions. CONCLUSION: BSHXF has the potential to 
      alleviate OA by suppressing inflammation, inhibiting cartilage apoptosis and 
      hindering extracellular matrix degradation via the IL-17 signaling pathway. Our 
      study elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of 
      BSHXF on OA, thus highlighting its further research implications as a novel drug 
      candidate.

TI  - Network Pharmacology with Metabolomics Study to Reveal the Mechanisms of Bushen 
      Huoxue Formula in Intervertebral Disc Degeneration Treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a pathophysiological 
      process that leads to severe back pain or neurological deficits. The Bushen 
      Huoxue Formula (BSHXF) is a traditional herbal remedy widely used to treat 
      diseases related to IVDD. However, its pharmacological mechanism needs further 
      exploration. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms through 
      which BSHXF treats IVDD-related diseases by integrating metabolomics with network 
      pharmacology. METHODS: Network pharmacology was utilized to identify potential 
      targets of BSHXF against IVDD. Additionally, an animal model of needle 
      puncture-induced disc degeneration was established to assess the effect of BSHXF. 
      Mice were randomly assigned to the sham group, model group, and BSHXF group. 
      Various techniques, including PCR, CCK-8 assay, MRI, histological examinations, 
      and immunohistochemical analyses, were employed to evaluate degenerative and 
      oxidative stress conditions in mouse disc tissue and cultured nucleus pulposus 
      (NP) cells. UHPLC-HRMS/MS was used to differential distinct metabolites in the 
      disc tissue from different groups, and MetaboAnalyst 5.0 was employed to enrich 
      the metabolic pathways. RESULTS: Through network pharmacology, 15 core proteins 
      were identified through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction. 
      Functional enrichment analysis highlighted the critical role of BSHXF in 
      addressing IVDD by influencing the response to oxidative stress. Furthermore, 
      experimental evidence demonstrated that BSHXF significantly improved the 
      pathological progression of IVDD and increased oxidative stress markers SOD-1 and 
      GPX1, both in the disc degeneration model and cultured NP cells. Metabolomics 
      identified differential metabolites among the three groups, revealing 15 
      metabolic pathways between the sham and model groups, and 13 metabolic pathways 
      enriched between the model and BSHXF groups. CONCLUSION: This study, integrating 
      network pharmacology and metabolomics, suggests that BSHXF can alleviate IVDD 
      progression by modulating oxidative stress. Key metabolic pathways associated 
      with BSHXF-mediated reduction of oxidative stress include the citrate cycle, 
      cysteine and methionine metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, 
      glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, 
      glutathione metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism. While this research 
      demonstrates the therapeutic potential of BSHXF in reducing oxidative stress 
      levels in IVDD, further research is needed to thoroughly understand its 
      underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Bu-Shen-Huo-Xue-Fang modulates nucleus pulposus cell proliferation and 
      extracellular matrix remodeling in intervertebral disk degeneration through 
      miR-483 regulation of Wnt pathway.
PG  - 19318-19329

AB  - Intervertebral disk degeneration (IDD) has been widely considered as one of the 
      main causes for low back pain, which can cause a severe impact to human health 
      and huge economic burden to worldwide society. IDD pathogenesis can be affected 
      by extensive degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and the hyperproliferation 
      of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. During the IDD process, expression of the ECM 
      degradation enzymes matrix metalloproteinase and ADAMTS increases, whereas 
      expression of ECM synthesis-related aggrecan and COL2A1 decreases. In addition, 
      the Wnt signaling pathway is reportedly involved in the process of IDD. 
      Bu-Shen-Huo-Xue-Fang (BSHXF), a Chinese traditional medicine formula that 
      contains six Chinese traditional medicinal herbs, is widely used in the treatment 
      of IDD. Herein, we obtained the serum containing BSHXF from BSHXF-fed rat and 
      demonstrated that the BSHXF promoted NP cell proliferation and ECM synthesis 
      through the Wnt signaling pathway. By using DIANA online tools and luciferase 
      reporter gene assays, we confirmed that miR-483-3p and miR-23c regulated CTNNB1 
      and GSK3B, respectively, through direct targeting, thereby affecting the effect 
      of BSHXF on NP cell proliferation and ECM synthesis through the Wnt signaling 
      pathway. Taken together, we demonstrated the function and mechanism of BSHXF in 
      regulating NP cell proliferation and ECM remodeling through the Wnt signaling 
      pathway during IDD.

AB  - Degeneration of the intervertebral disc is primarily caused by the loss of 
      nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) and extracellular matrix (ECM) (IDD). 
      Bu-Shen-Huo-Xue-Fang (BSHXF), a traditional Chinese medicine decoction, has been 
      used to treat IDD in clinical; nevertheless, the active components and underlying 
      molecular mechanisms remain unknown. BSHXF improved IL-1β and H(2)O(2) 
      stimulation-induced injuries on NPCs by promoting cell viability, increasing ECM 
      deposition, inhibiting cell senescence, and decreasing the levels of inflammatory 
      factors. The active ingredients in BSHXF were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis; 
      three active ingredients from the principal drugs, Aucubin, Tanshinol, and 
      Tanshinone II A promoted NPC viability; and Aucubin and Tanshinol promoted NPC 
      viability more. Aucubin and Tanshinol, respectively, improved H(2)O(2) 
      stimulation-induced injuries on NPCs by promoting cell viability, increasing ECM 
      deposition, inhibiting cell senescence, and decreasing the levels of inflammatory 
      factors. The activator of NF-κB and Wnt signaling pathways attenuated Aucubin and 
      Tanshinol's protective effects by promoting ECM degradation and NPC senescence. 
      Aucubin, Tanshinol, and Tanshinone II A were identified as the most potent 
      compounds in BSHXF protection against degenerative changes in NPCs. The NF-κB and 
      Wnt signaling pathways might be involved in the protective effects of Aucubin and 
      Tanshinol against H(2)O(2)-induced degenerative changes.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is the most common 
      chronic joint disorder worldwide, which is also a principle consideration for 
      disability. The Bushenhuoxue formula (BSHXF) is a traditional herbal formula 
      which widely applied to the treatment of KOA. However, its pharmacological 
      mechanisms of action have not been clarified. AIMS OF THE STUDY: The study aimed 
      to identify the potential targets and mechanisms of BSHXF in the treatment of KOA 
      through pharmacology-based analyses and experimental validation. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The TCMSP database was applied to obtain the chemical compounds and 
      targets of BSHXF, while the protein targets in KOA were determined through 
      GeneCards and OMIM databases. The herb-compound-target and protein-protein 
      interaction (PPI) networks were constructed for topological analyses and 
      hub-targets screening. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed on these 
      core nodes to identify the critical biological processes and signaling pathways. 
      Then destabilization of medial meniscus (DMM)-induced C57BL/6J mice model was 
      established to detect the level of apoptosis via TUNEL assessment, while the 
      expressions of CASP3, CASP8 and CASP9 were determined by immunohistochemistry. 
      RESULTS: A total of 154 active compounds and 58 targets were predicted. DAVID, 
      ClueGO and Metascape enrichment analyses all proved that BSHXF plays an essential 
      role in regulating apoptosis. Moreover, 3 central nodes of BSHXF are recognized 
      as the active factors involved in the main biological functions, suggesting a 
      potential mechanism of BSHXF for KOA treatment. In vivo experiment revealed that 
      BSHXF significantly inhibited apoptosis and down-regulated the expressions of 
      CASP3, CASP8 and CASP9. CONCLUSION: Based on network pharmacology and 
      experimental validation, our study indicated that BSHXF exerted anti-apoptosis 
      effect through inhibiting the expressions of CASP3, CASP8 and CASP9, which could 
      be considered as an effective method for KOA treatment.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bushen Huoxue formula (BSHXF) is a Chinese herbal 
      prescription composed of eleven herbs widely used to treat psychological 
      stress-induced premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in clinical. However, the 
      underlying mechanism is still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this 
      study was to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms of BSHXF in the 
      treatment of psychological stress-induced POI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The rat 
      model was induced by corticosterone (CORT, 40mg/kg). Drugs were administered to 
      rats once daily for 21 days. The serum E(2), FSH and AMH levels were examined by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Tandem mass tag-based proteomic analysis was 
      used to identify differentially expressed proteins. Western blot was used to 
      verify the results of proteomic. RESULTS: Our results indicate that BSHXF can 
      improve ovarian disfunction. The levels of serum FSH were signally enhanced in 
      model group compared to control group. As respected, BSHXF treatment for 3 weeks 
      led to the decreased FSH levels than the model group. The concentrations of AMH 
      showed an obvious decrease in the model group and were increased by BSHXF 
      treatment. Moreover, the size and number of follicles in the BSHXF groups were 
      similar to those in the control group. The proteomic screened out that Np4 and 
      Angptl4 were simultaneously enriched by GO and KEGG, thus these two proteins were 
      chosen for further study. CONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed that BSHXF might 
      regulate the expression of Np4 and Angptl4 to improve psychological 
      stress-induced POI.

TI  - Bushen Huoxue Formula Modulates Autophagic Flux and Inhibits Apoptosis to Protect 
      Nucleus Pulposus Cells by Restoring the AMPK/SIRT1 Pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) has the characteristics of chronic and 
      persistence, which is a heavy social burden. Intervertebral disc degeneration 
      (IVDD) is a major cause of LBP. The typical features of IVDD are extracellular 
      matrix (ECM) degradation and nucleus pulposus cell (NP) apoptosis. Bushen Huoxue 
      Formula (BSHXF) has good clinical effects on LBP. However, the mechanism of BSHXF 
      affecting ECM and NP cells is still unclear. Aim of the Study. In this study, the 
      impact of BSHXF on autophagy and apoptosis of NP cells was studied through the 
      AMPK/SIRT1 pathway. Material and Methods. NP cells were extracted through the 
      digestion of collagenase and trypsin, and the components of BSHXF were 
      identified. Cell Counting Kit-8 was applied to detect the impact of BSHXF on NP 
      cells. Mitochondrial function was detected using MitoTracker assay, ATP kit, and 
      SOD kit. Autophagy and apoptosis were detected by RT-qPCR, western blotting, and 
      flow cytometry. RESULTS: BSHXF promoted NP cell survival in a 
      concentration-dependent manner, and the elimination of rat serum did not increase 
      cell proliferation; TNF-α accelerated ECM degradation, ROS accumulation, and NP 
      cell apoptosis and decreased autophagic flux. BSHXF restored mitochondrial 
      function and autophagic flux. In addition, AMPK/SIRT1 pathway activation was 
      associated with IVDD. CONCLUSIONS: BSHXF regulates autophagy and enhances 
      autophagic flux to suppress excessive ROS production and restore mitochondrial 
      function in an AMPK/SIRT1-dependent manner. However, the protection of BSHXF on 
      TNF-α-treated cells was eliminated by 3-MA. Furthermore, the protective impact of 
      BSHXF on ECM degradation and apoptosis induced by TNF-α was restrained by an AMPK 
      inhibitor. Therefore, maintaining the proper autophagy illustrates treatment 
      strategy for IVDD.

TI  - Bu Shen Huo Xue Formula Provides Neuroprotection Against Spinal Cord Injury by 
      Inhibiting Oxidative Stress by Activating the Nrf2 Signaling Pathway.

AB  - PURPOSE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is an irreversible neurological disease that 
      can result in severe neurological dysfunction. The Bu Shen Huo Xue Formula 
      (BSHXF) has been clinically shown to assist in the recovery of limb function in 
      patients with SCI. However, the underlying mechanisms of BSHXF's therapeutic 
      effects remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of BSHXF in a 
      mouse model of SCI and to identify potential therapeutic targets. METHODS: The 
      composition of BSHXF was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography 
      (HPLC). In vivo, SCI was induced in mice following established protocols, 
      followed by administration of BSHXF. Motor function was assessed using the 
      Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) and footprint tests. Levels of superoxide dismutase 
      (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were quantified with specific assay kits. Protein 
      expression analysis was performed using Western blot and immunofluorescence. 
      Additionally, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and apoptosis rates were 
      evaluated with dedicated staining kits. In vitro, neurons were exposed to 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to investigate the effects of BSHXF on neuronal 
      oxidative stress. The protective effects of BSHXF against LPS-induced neuronal 
      injury were examined through RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. 
      RESULTS: The eight primary bioactive constituents of BSHXF were identified using 
      HPLC. BSHXF significantly reduced tissue damage and enhanced functional recovery 
      following SCI. Meanwhile, BSHXF treatment led to significant reductions in 
      oxidative stress and apoptosis rates. It also reversed neuronal loss and reduced 
      glial scarring after SCI. LPS exposure induced neuronal apoptosis and axonal 
      degeneration; however, after intervention with BSHXF, neuronal damage was 
      reduced, and the protective effects of BSHXF were mediated by the activation of 
      the Nrf2 pathway. CONCLUSION: BSHXF decreased tissue damage and enhanced 
      functional recovery after SCI by protecting neurons against oxidative stress and 
      apoptosis. The effects of BSHXF on SCI may be related to the activation of the 
      Nrf2 pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lower back pain (LBP) arising from lumbar disc herniation (LDH) poses 
      a challenging health issue, often necessitating therapeutic interventions. Bushen 
      Huoxue formula (BSHXF) has proved as a potential treatment option with great 
      clinical effect. However, comprehensive investigations into its efficacy and 
      safety in conjunction with celecoxib for managing LBP from LDH are lacking. The 
      objective of this article is to investigate the efficacy and safety of BSHXF in 
      the management of patients with LBP from LDH. METHODS: This single center, 
      randomized clinical trial was conducted from March 2023 to September 2023 and all 
      patients suffered from LBP of LDH. Participants were randomly assigned to the 
      BSHXF group (celecoxib and BSHXF) or the control group (celecoxib and placebo). 
      The patients received treatment for 2 weeks. Assessment was conducted before 
      treatment, the last day of the treatment, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the 
      treatment. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), 
      Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Timed up and go test (TUGT), trunk 
      range of movement (Trunk ROM), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were 
      used for the evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 206 subjects completed treatment, 
      among whom 104 participants were randomized to the BSHXF group and 102 
      participants were randomized to the control group. There were no significant 
      differences between groups in terms of the observed indicators (P > .05). After 
      treatment, patients in BSHXF group obtained significant lower scores at 2-week, 
      4-week, 8-week of VAS, ODI, RMDQ, TUGT, Trunk ROM and HADS than the baseline data 
      (P < .05). The ODI score was significantly lower than the control group at 
      2-week, 4-week, 8-week (2w: 11.30 ± 5.80 vs 14.23 ± 6.33, P < .001; 4w: 
      10.95 ± 4.93 vs 13.54 ± 6.35, P < .001; 8w: 10.27 ± 5.25 vs 12.84 ± 6.57, 
      P = .002). Similarly, the scores of VAS, RMDQ, TUGT, Trunk ROM scores of the 
      BSHXF group markedly decreased at 2, 4, and 8-week when compared to their control 
      group (P < .05). Furthermore, no significant difference showed up in the score of 
      HADS between the between the BSHXF and the control group after treatment 
      (P > .05). CONCLUSION: This randomized clinical trial found that BSXHF can help 
      significantly improve the clinical outcomes of celecoxib including pain intensity 
      reduction and lumbar function improvement in LBP patients.

AB  - Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang (BYHWT) is one of the most popular formulated traditional 
      Chinese medicine prescriptions, and is widely for prevention of ischemic 
      cardio-cerebral vascular diseases and stroke-induced disability. A specific 
      high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) has 
      been developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of the nine main 
      bioactive components, i.e., astragaloside I, astragaloside II, astragaloside IV, 
      formononetin, ononin, calycosin, calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside, ligustilide and 
      paeoniflorin in rat plasma after oral administration of BYHWT extract. This 
      method was applied to investigate the pharmacokinetics in conscious and freely 
      moving rats. No significant matrix effects were observed. The overall analytical 
      procedure was rapid and reproducible, which makes it suitable for quantitative 
      analysis of a large number of samples. Among them, three astragalosides and four 
      isoflavones in A. membranaceus, ligustilide in Radix Angelicae Sinensis and 
      Rhizoma Ligustici Chuanxiong and paeoniflorin in Radix Paeoniae Rubra were 
      identified. This developed method was then successfully applied to 
      pharmacokinetic studies of the nine bioactive constituents after oral 
      administration of BYHWT extracts in rats. The pharmacokinetic data demonstrated 
      that astragaloside I, astragaloside II, astragaloside IV and ligustilide 
      presented the phenomenon of double peaks. The other herbal ingredients of 
      formononetin, ononin, calycosin, calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside and paeoniflorin 
      appeared together in a single and plateau absorption phase. These phenomenona 
      suggest that these components may have multiple absorption sites, regulation of 
      enterohepatic circulation or the gastric emptying rate, or there is 
      ingredient-ingredient interaction. These pharmacokinetic results provide a 
      constructive contribution to better understand the absorption mechanism of BYHWT 
      and to support additional clinical evaluation.

TI  - Protective function of Bu Shen Huo Xue formula on the immunity of B6AF1 mice with 
      experimental autoimmune premature ovarian failure.
PG  - 3302-3310

AB  - Autoimmune abnormality is one of the main causes of premature ovarian failure 
      (POF). Bu Shen Huo Xue formula (BSHXF), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, 
      has been clinically used for the treatment of patients with POF in China. 
      Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are important in the pathogenesis of autoimmune POF. 
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the immunoprotective effects of 
      BSHXF on POF and the underlying mechanisms. An experimental autoimmune POF model 
      was induced in B6AF1 mice with zona pellucida 3 (ZP3) fragments. Following 
      modeling, BSHXF (31.53 g/kg/day) was orally administered for 4 weeks. CD4(+) T 
      lymphocytes, Tregs, anti-zona pellucida (anti-ZP) antibodies and cytokines were 
      detected using flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, reverse 
      transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. 
      The results revealed that BSHXF exhibited an immunoprotective function and 
      reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and damage to the ovary. BSHXF upregulated 
      the percentage of CD4(+) CD25(+) forkhead box P3(+) T cells in the spleen, 
      effectively inhibiting the activation of CD4(+) T lymphocytes. The proliferation 
      of Tregs was increased in serum obtained from mice in the BSHXF group in vitro. 
      Anti-ZP antibodies and interleukin-10 and interferon-γ levels were decreased in 
      the serum in the BSHXF-treated group. The present study demonstrated that BSHXF 
      had an immunoprotective effect on POF model mice. Additionally, it indicated that 
      the protective mechanisms of BSHXF may be associated with an increase in Treg 
      cells.

      traumatic fracture].
PG  - 251-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To research the effect of Bu Yang Huan Wu Soup (BYHWS) and Tong Mai 
      Soup (TMS) within varieties on D-Di, PLC, Pagt of traumatic fracture. METHOD: 48 
      cases are choosen, those are femoral-fractured, age between 18 to 45-year-old and 
      in level I - II of ASA. The cases were randomly arranged into 3 groups, 16 cases 
      are in each group. Group I is the controlled one, it isn't used any medicine 
      which affects cruor. Group II is used BYHWS. Group III is used TMS. Group II and 
      III are used medicine for 7 days from the first day in hospital. All patients in 
      3 groups are checked D-Di, PLC, Pagt in blood in the first day and the seventh 
      day,and their results are compared with the healthy adult's. RESULTS: (1) 
      Comparing the D-Di of all 3 groups with the healthy adult's on the second day, P 
      <0.01. The D-Di value of group I and group III grows up in 7 days, group I's is 
      higher than group III's, but both of them P > 0.01. Value of group II is 
      decreased in 7 days, P < 0.05. (2)PLC of all 3 groups is compared with healthy 
      adult's, P > 0.01. On the seventh day, PLC of group I and group III increase 
      obviously, P < 0.01. Group II's increases to P <0.05. (3) Pagt of 1st day of 3 
      groups is compared with the healthy adult's, P <0.05. On the 7th day, Pagt 
      increases,in group I P < 0.01, in group II P < 0. 05. in group III P > 0.01. 
      CONCLUSION: Pagt rises after traumatic fracture, the blood is in high-agglomerate 
      situation. Chinese traditional medicine BYHWS and TMS can decrease the blood 
      platelet assemble after trauma a certain extent.

TI  - Network pharmacology and transcriptomics analysis reveal the mechanism of 
      BushenHuoxue formula attenuates premature ovarian failure via modulation PI3K/AKT 
      pathway.
PG  - 226-232
LID - 10.14715/cmb/2024.70.5.33 [doi]
AB  - This study aims to analyze the active components and mechanism of Bushen Huoxue 
      (BSHX) formula on the autoimmune premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) by 
      combining network pharmacology and Transcriptomics. The active components and 
      targets of BSHXF were screened through Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems 
      Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). POI-related targets were 
      identified through Therapeutic Targets Database (TTD), DisGeNET and drugbank 
      database. The Veen diagram was performed to obtain the action targets. The active 
      compound-target network and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network were built 
      by using STRING database and Cytoscape software. Key targets and active compounds 
      were further identified by topological analysis. Molecular docking shows that 
      Kaempferol, Isorhamnetin and Anhydroicaritin have strong binding to AKT. Finally, 
      a zp3-induced autoimmune ovarian function deficiency mouse model was used to 
      explore the potential mechanism of POI. The potential pathways of BSHXF for the 
      treatment of POI were identified by Transcriptomic analysis. PI3K-AKT and NF-kb 
      pathways were the common pathways between network pharmacology and 
      transcriptomics. Our results revealed that BSHXF could reduce the FSH expression 
      levels and raise the E2, and AMH levels in the serum. Western bloting 
      demonstrates that BSHXF could upregulate the expression of p-PI3K and p-AKT.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Bushen Huoxue Formula in Patients with Discogenic Low-Back 
      Pain: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.
PG  - 963-970

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of Bushen Huoxue Formula (BSHXF) for 
      the treatment of discogenic low-back pain (DLBP). METHODS: This was a parallel, 
      double-blind, randomized, clinical trial performed between May 2019 and June 
      2020. Seventy patients were assigned by computerized random number table to the 
      treatment group (lumbar traction and BSHXF, 35 cases) or the control group 
      (lumbar traction and placebo, 35 cases). The patients received intervention for 3 
      weeks. Assessment was conducted before treatment and at week 1, 2, 3 during 
      treatment. Primary outcome was the self-reported score of Oswestry Disability 
      Index (ODI). Secondary outcomes included Visual Analog Scale (VAS), clinical 
      efficacy rate by minimal clinically important difference (MCID) as well as lumbar 
      tenderness, muscle tone and lumbar spine mobility. Adverse reactions were 
      recorded. Follow-up was performed at 1 and 3 months after the end of treatment. 
      RESULTS: In the treatment group, ODI score was significantly decreased compared 
      with baseline (P<0.05) and the control group at 2- and 3- week treatment. 
      Similarly, VAS score decreased compared with the baseline (P<0.05) and was lower 
      than that in the control group at 2- and 3- week treatment (P<0.05). The clinical 
      efficacy rate of the treatment group was higher than that of the control group 
      after treatment [32.35% (11/34) vs. 3.13% (1/32), P<0.05). Moreover, the 
      tenderness, and muscle tone, as well as the back extension and left flexion in 
      lumbar spine mobility in the treatment group at 3-week treatment were 
      significantly improved compared with the control group (P<0.05). Follow-up showed 
      that at 1-month after treatment, the treatment group had better outcomes than the 
      control group with regard to a total score of ODI and VAS scores, as well as 
      clinical efficacy rate (all P<0.05). Moreover, VAS score was still significantly 
      lower than the control group at 3-month follow-up (P<0.05). No adverse reactions 
      were reported during the study. CONCLUSION: BSXHF combined with lumbar traction 
      can significantly improve the clinical symptoms including pain intensity, 
      functionality, muscle tone, and lumbar spine mobility in DLBP patients.

TI  - Bushen Huoxue Formula alleviates lipid accumulation in premature ovarian

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bushen Huoxue Formula (BSHXF), a traditional Chinese medicine, 
      effectively treats premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) by modulating of lipid 
      metabolism. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism 
      through which BSHXF improves POI by regulating lipid metabolism. METHODS: Network 
      pharmacology identified potential pathways associated with BSHXF in POI. A POI 
      rat model was induced using subcutaneous corticosterone injections and treated 
      with BSHXF to assess its efficacy. The impact of BSHXF on lipid metabolism, 
      autophagy, and the LRP6/β-catenin signaling pathway was evaluated in these rats. 
      Additionally, palmitic acid (PA)-induced granulosa cells (KGN cells) were used in 
      vitro. A LRP6 inhibitor (Salinomycin sodium salt, Sal) was applied to these 
      cells, followed by a series of molecular biology experiments to elucidate the 
      specific regulatory role of BSHXF on lipid metabolism. RESULTS: Network 
      pharmacology analysis indicated that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a 
      potential target of BSHXF in POI. In vivo, BSHXF alleviated POI-like symptoms in 
      rats, reduced lipid accumulation, suppressed excessive autophagy, and activated 
      the LRP6/β-catenin signaling pathway. In vitro, Sal inhibited the ability of 
      BSHXF-containing serum to activate LRP6/β-catenin signaling, reduce lipid 
      accumulation, and counteract excessive autophagy in PA-induced KGN cells. This 
      was accompanied by increased expression of LRP6 and β-catenin, enhanced 
      lipogenesis, elevated lipid droplet formation, decreased lipid catabolism, and 
      oxidation, and enhanced autophagic flux. Cycloheximide chase and Western blot 
      analyses further confirmed that BSHXF stabilizes LRP6 by inhibiting its 
      ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. CONCLUSIONS: BSHXF activates LRP6/β-catenin 
      signaling pathway by inhibiting the ubiquitination degradation of LRP6, thereby 
      improving POI. This study reveals that BSHXF may improve POI by modulating LRP6 
      stability, thereby affecting lipid metabolism.

TI  - Bushenhuoxue Formula Protects Against Lumbar Facet Joint Osteoarthritis via 
      Acting on TDP-43-Mediated Pyroptosis to Loose Caspase-11/NLRP3 Interaction.
LID - 10.1177/15491684251382419 [doi]
AB  - Background: Facet joint osteoarthritis (FJOA) is a serious facet joint cartilage 
      degeneration disorder, which is an important cause of low back pain and 
      disability. Bushenhuoxue formula (BSHXF), a traditional Chinese herbal compound, 
      has been demonstrated to exhibit the ability to improve osteoarthritis. This 
      study aimed to uncover the therapeutic effect and potential mechanism of BSHXF in 
      FJOA. Methods: FJOA rats were treated with BSHXF. Histological staining, 
      immunohistochemistry, TUNEL staining, and flow cytometry were performed for 
      detecting pathological damage, molecule expressions in articular cartilage, 
      chondrocyte apoptosis, and pyroptosis, respectively. Interleukin (IL)-18 and 
      IL-1β levels were quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RT-qPCR and 
      Western blot were carried out for evaluating mRNA and protein expressions. 
      Immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation were used to study the 
      colocalization and interaction between Caspase-11 and Nod-like receptor protein-3 
      (NLRP3) in chondrocytes. Results: In FJOA rats, BSHXF attenuated articular 
      cartilage pathological damage. Specifically, BSHXF inhibited matrix degradation, 
      as indicated by increasing collagen II and decreasing matrix metalloproteinase 
      13. BSHXF inhibited articular chondrocyte apoptosis and promoted chondrocyte 
      proliferation. BSHXF decreased Caspase-1 and NLRP3, reduced the rate of 
      Caspase-1/propidium iodide-stained chondrocytes, and inhibited inflammatory 
      cytokines, indicating the attenuated articular chondrocyte pyroptosis. BSHXF 
      downregulated Caspase-11, loosened the interaction between NLRP3 and Caspase-11, 
      as well as upregulated transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in 
      FJOA rats. Additionally, in H(2)O(2)-exposed chondrocytes, TDP-43 overexpression 
      decreased TLR4, p-IκBα, NF-κB P65, and Caspase-11 and declined the 
      co-localization of Caspase-11 and NLRP3. Importantly, TDP-43 knockdown reversed 
      BSHXF-mediated protective effects in FJOA rats. Conclusion: BSHXF inhibited 
      chondrocyte pyroptosis by increasing TDP-43 to protect against FJOA via loosening 
      the interaction of Caspase-11 and NLRP3, which may provide a fundamental basis 
      for treating FJOA cartilage damage. [Figure: see text].

      Paeonia lactiflora, Ligusticum chuanxiong, Carthamus tinctorius, Amygdalus 
      persica and Pheretima aspergillum), that has been used in China for centuries to 
      overcome stroke-induced disability. To ensure the consistency of quality, a 
      reliable analytical method is required, therefore, we developed a liquid 
      chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for quantitative 
      analysis of the major constituents in BYHWT. The herbal ingredients consisting of 
      the cycloartane-type triterpene glycosides of astragaloside I, astragaloside II 
      and astragaloside IV; isoflavones of formononetin, ononin calycosin, 
      calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside; ligustilide and paeoniflorin were separated on a C18 
      column with gradient elution of methanol/10 mM ammonium acetate buffer-formic 
      acid (100:0.1, v/v). This study was performed by a mass spectrometer using 
      electrospray ionization (ESI) with positive ionization ions monitored in the 
      multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode. The linearity, accuracy, precision, 
      limit of detection (LOD) and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were validated 
      for this quantification method, and the sensitivity, reliability and 
      reproducibility were all confirmed. The experiments provided a good method for 
      analyzing BYHWT extracts. This study also quantitated the active components in 
      various brands of commercially available products. The results indicated that the 
      pharmaceutical industrial products of BYHWT exhibited considerable variation in 
      their contents of the herbal compounds.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a major cause of 
      mortality. Inflammation exerts an essential part of brain-heart communication 
      after IS. Naoxintong capsule (NXT), derived from the classical Traditional 
      Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulation Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu-Tang, are extensively employed 
      in China to manage IS, myocardial infarction (MI), and atherosclerosis. Previous 
      clinical studies have demonstrated the protective effects of NXT in 
      anti-atherosclerosis, cerebral infarction, angina, and acute coronary syndrome. 
      However, the potential therapeutic mechanism of NXT for IS remains unknown. AIM 
      OF THE STUDY: This study aims to investigate a potential mechanism for enhancing 
      brain-heart interaction following an ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      C57BL/6J mice underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 
      durations of 6, 12, and 24 h. The effects of NXT on the brain were observed via 
      TTC, Nissl and TUNEL staining, immunofluorescence staining, and Zea-Longa scores. 
      Simultaneously, the effects of NXT on the heart were evaluated via H&E staining 
      and echocardiography. Inflammatory factors in heart and serum were determined via 
      ELISA or luminex liquid suspension chip detection. Network pharmacology predicted 
      the targets and signaling pathways of NXT. The binding affinity between potential 
      targets and active compounds of NXT was assessed through molecular docking. The 
      expression levels of IκBα, IKKβ, NF-κB, NLRP3, and caspase-1 were evaluated via 
      Western blotting. RESULTS: The Zea-Longa scores, infarct rate, and the rate of 
      apoptosis in the brain at 6, 12, and 24 h of MCAO mice were markedly decreased by 
      NXT. Additionally, they clearly enhanced the NeuN positive rate and prevented 
      microglia from activating at 24 h. NXT significantly reduced the level of 
      myocardial injury biomarkers (Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Creatine kinase 
      isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) at 24 h, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro 
      BNP) at 6, 12, and 24 h), improved ejection fraction, fractional shortening, 
      stroke volume, and cardiac output at 24 h. The levels of MIP-1α in cardiac tissue 
      and IL-1β in serum were both markedly lowered by NXT. Furthermore, the 
      NF-κB/NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathways may be potential mechanisms of NXT. 
      Molecular docking indicated that IKKβ, IκBα, NF-κB, NLRP3, and caspase-1 may 
      serve as potential targets for the action of representative active ingredients in 
      NXT. NXT could reduce the expression levels of IKKβ, NF-κB, NLRP3, and caspase-1 
      in brain and heart tissues while increasing the expression of IκBα. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study illustrates that NXT efficiently attenuated inflammation in the brain 
      and heart by blocking the NF-κB/NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathway. These findings 
      provide appealing insights into the multi-organ perspective on human health via 
      identifying shared inflammatory impacts and heart-brain linkages.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Stroke has been the leading causes of death 
      worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for stoke patients 
      for thousands of years. This study aimed to investigate TCM usage and 
      prescription patterns in stroke patients in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      analyzed a random sample of one million individuals representing the 23 million 
      enrollees selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database in 
      Taiwan. Demographic characteristics, TCM usage, prescription patterns and 
      mortality rate among stroke patients were analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 23,816 
      patients who were newly diagnosed with stroke between 2001 and 2009 by their 
      diagnostic codes (ICD-9-CM 430-438). Among them, 4302 patients had hemorrhagic 
      stroke while 19,514 patients had ischemic stroke. Overall, 12% of the stroke 
      patients (n=2862) were TCM users. The median interval between stroke onset to the 
      first TCM consultation is 12.2 months. Among the TCM users, more than half 
      (52.7%) of the patients received both Chinese herbal remedies and 
      acupuncture/traumatology treatment. Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang and Dan-shen (Radix 
      Salviae Miltiorrhizae; Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge) was the most commonly 
      prescribed Chinese herbal formula and single herb, respectively. TCM users had a 
      higher incidence rate ratio in myalgia, myositis, fasciitis and insomnia than 
      non-TCM users. Mental disorders such as anxiety and depression are common in both 
      TCM and non-TCM users. Comparing with the non-TCM users, the TCM users had a 
      lower mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratios were 0.44 in overall stroke, 0.50 in 
      ischemic stroke and 0.25 in hemorrhagic stroke). CONCLUSION: Adjunctive TCM use 
      may reduce the risk of mortality rate among stroke patients. Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang 
      and Dan-shen are the most common prescribed Chinese herbal formula and single 
      herb for stroke patients, respectively. Future study investigating the 
      anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective efficacy of Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang and 
      Dan-shen in stroke is warranted.

TI  - Investigating the regulation of the miR-199a-3p/TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway by 
      BSHXF drug-containing serum combined with ADSCs for delaying intervertebral disc 
      degeneration.
PG  - 1583635
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2025.1583635 [doi]
LID - 1583635
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) significantly contributes to 
      low back pain (LBP), yet effective treatment options are scarce. BSHXF, a 
      classical traditional Chinese medicine formula, demonstrates dual pharmacological 
      actions: tonifying kidneys, strengthening bones, activating blood circulation, 
      and resolving stasis. It has been widely used in IDD management. Given its 
      potential, combining BSHXF with miRNA regulation and stem cell therapy may 
      enhance therapeutic outcomes by targeting molecular and cellular pathways 
      underlying IDD pathogenesis. AIM OF THE STUDY: IDD is recognized as one of the 
      primary causes of low back pain, yet effective therapeutic interventions for this 
      condition remain limited. This study explores the role of BSHXF drug-containing 
      serum combined with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in slowing IDD progression 
      via the miR-199a-3p/TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. By comprehensively 
      investigating the synergistic effects of this combination therapy, we aim to 
      propose a novel multi-target strategy that addresses the complex pathogenesis of 
      IDD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study employed a combination of in vivo and in 
      vitro models. An IDD model was induced in rat caudal intervertebral discs through 
      needle puncture, while an oxidative stress-induced ADSCs injury model was created 
      in vitro using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (T-BHP). Cell viability was measured with 
      the CCK-8 assay. Cell cycle distribution and mitochondrial reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS) levels were assessed using flow cytometry. Cellular senescence was 
      assessed using SA-β-galactosidase staining. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity 
      was quantified to evaluate cellular damage. Differentiation into nucleus 
      pulposus-like cells was assessed using immunofluorescence double staining for 
      CD73 and COL2A1. ELISA was used to measure inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, 
      IL-4, IL-10) in cell supernatants. miR-199a-3p expression was determined using 
      RT-qPCR. Western blotting was employed to quantify COL2A1, SOX9, and ACAN protein 
      levels, reflecting nucleus pulposus-like differentiation and extracellular matrix 
      (ECM) synthesis capacity. Western blotting was employed to assess pathway 
      activity by analyzing the protein expressions of TGF-β1, Smad2, Smad3, and their 
      phosphorylated forms, P-Smad2 and P-Smad3. In vivo experiments assessed 
      histopathological degeneration through hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Safranin O-Fast 
      Green staining. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyzed COL1A1 and COL2A1 expression 
      levels. RT-qPCR quantified miR-199a-3p expression. Western blotting was employed 
      to assess the expression levels of TGF-β1, Smad2, Smad3, P-Smad2, and P-Smad3 for 
      pathway regulation evaluation. RESULTS: Our experimental results demonstrated 
      that serum containing BSHXF significantly alleviated T-BHP-induced oxidative 
      stress, improved the cellular microenvironment, promoted ADSCs proliferation, and 
      decelerated cellular senescence. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that BSHXF 
      significantly activated the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, driving the 
      differentiation of ADSCs into nucleus pulposus-like cells and restoring normal 
      cell cycle progression. Overexpression of miR-199a-3p inhibited the TGF-β/Smad 
      pathway, leading to ECM degradation and elevated expression of inflammatory 
      factors (TNF-α, IL-1β). In contrast, BSHXF restored TGF-β/Smad pathway activity 
      by downregulating miR-199a-3p expression. In vivo experiments demonstrated that 
      miR-199a-3p overexpression exacerbated IDD, characterized by reduced COL2A1 
      expression, elevated COL1A1 levels, and increased disc fibrosis. BSHXF 
      intervention markedly attenuated IDD progression by downregulating miR-199a-3p 
      expression, reducing disc fibrosis, and effectively restoring collagen 
      expression. CONCLUSION: BSHXF activated the TGF-β/Smad pathway to promote the 
      differentiation of ADSCs into nucleus pulposus-like cells. It exerted protective 
      effects by alleviating oxidative stress damage, improving the microenvironment, 
      delaying senescence, and enhancing cellular functions. This study is the first to 
      reveal that miR-199a-3p overexpression exacerbates intervertebral disc fibrosis 
      and degeneration. BSHXF restored TGF-β/Smad pathway activity by downregulating 
      miR-199a-3p expression, thereby improving disc structure and function. This 
      integrated approach offers a novel multi-target intervention strategy for IDD, 
      demonstrating significant therapeutic potential.

AB  - TMED2 is involved in morphogenesis of the mouse embryo and placenta. We found 
      that expression of TMED2 was higher in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues than 
      normal ovarian tissues. Silencing TMED2 decreased cell proliferation, migration, 
      and invasion. Ectopic expression of TMED2 increased cell proliferation, migration 
      and invasion. Silencing TMED2 inhibited ovarian cancer growth in mice. Silencing 
      TMED2 inhibited IGF2/IGF1R/PI3K/Akt pathway. In agreement, ectopically expressed 
      TMED2 activated IGF2/IGF1R/PI3K/Akt pathway. Mechanistic study revealed that 
      TMED2 directly binds to AKT2, thereby facilitating its phosphorylation. We also 
      found that TMED2 increased IGF1R expression by competing for miR-30a. Thus, TMED2 
      is oncogenic and a potential target for epithelial ovarian cancer therapy.

TI  - Chinese Herbal Products for Ischemic Stroke.
PG  - 1365-79
LID - 10.1142/S0192415X15500779 [doi]
AB  - Traditional Chinese herbal products (CHPs) have been described in ancient 
      medicine systems as treatments for various stroke-associated ailments. This study 
      is aimed to investigate the prescription patterns and combinations of CHPs for 
      ischemic stroke in Taiwan. Prescriptions of CHPs for ischemic stroke were 
      obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. 
      Every prescription with a leading diagnosis of ischemic stroke made during 
      2000-2010 was analyzed. Descriptive statistics were applied to the pattern of 
      co-prescriptions. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess 
      demographic and risk factors that are correlated with CHP use. The dataset of 
      inpatient claims data contained information on 15,896 subjects who experienced 
      ischemic stroke from 2000 to 2010. There was an average of 5.82 CHPs in a single 
      prescription for subjects with ischemic stroke. Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang (BYHWT) 
      (40.32%) was by far the most frequently prescribed formula CHP for ischemic 
      stroke, and the most commonly used combination of two-formula-CHP was BYHWT with 
      Shu-jin-huo-xue-tang (SJHXT) (4.40%). Dan Shen (16.50%) was the most commonly 
      used single CHP for ischemic stroke, and the most commonly used combination of 
      two single CHPs was Shi Chang Pua with Yuan Zhi (4.79%). We found that BYHWT and 
      Dan Shen were the most frequently prescribed formula and single CHP for ischemic 
      stroke, respectively. These results provide information about individualized 
      therapy and may contribute to further pharmacologic experiments and clinical 
      trials.

TI  - BRG1 promotes liver cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by enhancing 
      mitochondrial function and ATP5A1 synthesis through TOMM40.

LID - 2375440
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignant tumors 
      worldwide. Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), as a catalytic ATPase, is a major 
      regulator of gene expression and is known to mutate and overexpress in HCC. The 
      purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of action of BRG1 in HCC 
      cells. In our study, BRG1 was silenced or overexpressed in human HCC cell lines. 
      Transwell and wound healing assays were used to analyze cell invasiveness and 
      migration. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial permeability 
      transition pore (mPTP) detection were used to evaluate mitochondrial function in 
      HCC cells. Colony formation and cell apoptosis assays were used to evaluate the 
      effect of BRG1/TOMM40/ATP5A1 on HCC cell proliferation and apoptosis/death. 
      Immunocytochemistry (ICC), immunofluorescence (IF) staining and western blot 
      analysis were used to determine the effect of BRG1 on TOMM40, ATP5A1 pathway in 
      HCC cells. As a result, knockdown of BRG1 significantly inhibited cell 
      proliferation and invasion, promoted apoptosis in HCC cells, whereas BRG1 
      overexpression reversed the above effects. Overexpression of BRG1 can up-regulate 
      MMP level, inhibit mPTP opening and activate TOMM40, ATP5A1 expression. Our 
      results suggest that BRG1, as an oncogene, promotes HCC progression by regulating 
      TOMM40 affecting mitochondrial function and ATP5A1 synthesis. Targeting BRG1 may 
      represent a new and effective way to prevent HCC development.

TI  - Chinese Herbal Medicine for Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Montreal Cognitive 
      Assessment: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 578-592
LID - 10.1089/acm.2018.0346 [doi]
AB  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) prevalence is estimated at 6%-12% of 
      the population. It is possible that early treatment at the MCI stage could reduce 
      progression to more severe cognitive impairment. The Montreal Cognitive 
      Assessment (MoCA) is a sensitive measure used to assess changes in cognitive 
      function. Various Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) have been tested for effects on 
      MCI using MoCA. Objectives: To evaluate the clinical evidence for CHMs on MoCA 
      scores in MCI. Design: Five biomedical databases in English and Chinese language 
      were searched for randomized controlled trials that compared orally administered 
      CHMs with a control group and assessed changes in cognition using MoCA. Analyses 
      were based on the comparison, control intervention, and study duration. Mean 
      differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to evaluate treatment 
      effects. For each study, risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane 
      tool. Results: Nineteen studies were included with 16 contributing to the data 
      analyses. Three studies were placebo controlled. Nine compared a CHM with a 
      pharmacotherapy, three combined a CHM with a pharmacotherapy, and one combined 
      CHM with cognitive training. In the two placebo-controlled studies of 24-week 
      duration, results favored the CHMs at end of treatment. Conclusions: The 
      systematic review suggests that the oral application of certain CHMs improved 
      scores on MoCA by 1.76-2.34 points compared with placebo in people with MCI after 
      24 weeks of treatment. However, these two studies used different CHM 
      formulations. Two studies that tested the same CHM formulation, Bu Yang Huan Wu 
      Tang, in combination with donepezil, reported improvement in the integrative 
      groups, but the studies were not blind and the durations were only 8-12 weeks. 
      Overall, methodological weaknesses limited the strength of the evidence. The 
      herbal formulae included ingredients that have received considerable research 
      attention for their effects on memory and cognition. PROSPERO international

AB  - The aim of this study was to clarify the effects of BSHXF on pregnancy outcome 
      and macrophage polarization at the maternal-fetal interface in a mouse model of 
      recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). The RSA model was established using the 
      CBA/J × DBA/2 mating method. Network pharmacology predicted the mechanism of 
      BSHXF intervention in RSA and verified by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence 
      and RT-qPCR were used to measure the levels of macrophage-associated cytokines at 
      the maternal-fetal interface. Placental metabolomics was used to analyze the 
      mechanism of macrophage regulation by BSHXF and verified by ELISA. BSHXF improved 
      embryonic resorption and hormone levels in RSA mice and restored abnormal NF-κB 
      signaling, which was achieved in part by modulating macrophage polarisation 
      status. BSHXF intervention decreased M1 macrophage polarization while elevating 
      M2 macrophage levels. Metabolomics indicated that decreased inducible nitric 
      oxide synthase (iNOS) pathway and elevated arginase-1 pathway (Arg-1) pathway in 
      the placenta were the key mechanisms of macrophage polarization. This study 
      provides innovative insights into the mechanism by which BSHXF ameliorates RSA in 
      mice, providing a scientific basis for further pharmacological research.

AB  - PURPOSE: To construct a 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) CT radiomics-based deep learning 
      (DL) model to predict early postoperative recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients who 
      underwent HCC resection at 2 centers. The 232 patients from center 1 were 
      randomly divided into the training (162 patients) and internal validation cohorts 
      (70 patients); 91 patients from center 2 formed the external validation cohort. 
      We developed a 2.5D DL model based on a central 2D image with the maximum tumor 
      cross-section and adjacent slices. Multiple views (transverse, sagittal, and 
      coronal) and phases (arterial, plain, and portal) were incorporated. 
      Multi-instance learning techniques were applied to the extracted data; the 
      resulting comprehensive feature set was modeled using Logistic Regression, 
      RandomForest, ExtraTrees, XGBoost, and LightGBM, with 5-fold cross validation and 
      hyperparameter optimization with Grid-search. Receiver operating characteristic 
      curves, calibration curves, DeLong test, and decision curve analysis were used to 
      evaluate model performance. RESULTS: The 2.5D DL model performed well in the 
      training (AUC: 0.920), internal validation (AUC: 0.825), and external validation 
      cohorts (AUC: 0.795). The 3D DL model performed well in the training cohort and 
      poorly in the internal and external validation cohorts (AUCs: 0.751, 0.666, and 
      0.567, respectively), indicating overfitting. The combined model (2.5D 
      DL+clinical) performed well in all cohorts (AUCs: 0.921, 0.835, 0.804). The 
      Hosmer-Lemeshow test, DeLong test, and decision curve analysis confirmed the 
      superiority of the combined model over the other signatures. CONCLUSION: The 
      combined model integrating 2.5D DL and clinical features accurately predicts 
      early postoperative HCC recurrence.

TI  - Integrated Strategy of Network Pharmacological Prediction and Experimental 
      Validation Elucidate Possible Mechanism of Bu-Yang Herbs in Treating 
      Postmenopausal Osteoporosis via ESR1.
PG  - 654714

AB  - Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a type of bone metabolism disease-related 
      to estrogen deficiency with an increasing incidence. Traditional Chinese (TCM) 
      has always been used and showed effectiveness in treating PMOP. In the current 
      study, Bu-Yang herbs were considered to be the most frequently used and efficient 
      TCM herbs in PMOP treatment. However, chemical and pharmacological profiles were 
      not elucidated. Network pharmacology was conducted on representative Bu-Yang 
      herbs (Yin-Yang-Huo. Du-Zhong, Bu-Gu-Zhi, Tu-Si-Zi) to investigate the mechanism 
      of Bu-Yang herbs on PMOP. Chemical compounds, potential targets, and disease 
      related genes were available from the corresponding database. Results showed that 
      Bu-Yang herbs could interact with ESR1 and estrogen signaling pathways. For 
      further validation, the Bu-Yang decoction (BYD), formula consisted of the 
      above-mentioned 4 Bu-Yang herbs was presented for experimental validation. In 
      vivo, BYD significantly reversed ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis progress 
      in a dose-dependent manner by up-regulation of bone mineral density and 
      amelioration of bone microarchitecture. In vitro, BYD dramatically improved the 
      proliferation and mineral nodules formation of osteoblasts. Both in vitro and in 
      vivo results illustrated that the phenotype change induced by BYD is correlated 
      with up-regulated of ESR1 and activation of the β-catenin pathway. Meanwhile, 
      inhibition of ESR1 by ICI182, 780 blocked the osteogenic phenotype and β-catenin 
      pathway activation induced by BYD. In conclusion, the current study suggested 
      that Bu-Yang herbs are the most useful TCM herbs in treating PMOP. Furthermore, 
      the integrated strategy of network pharmacology prediction with experimental 
      validation suggested that BYD exerted its anti-PMOP via ESR1 and the downstream 
      mechanism might be activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway.

TI  - Immune Evasion Mechanism Mediated by ITPRIPL1 and Its Prognostic Implications in 
      Glioma.
PG  - e70762
LID - 10.1002/brb3.70762 [doi]
LID - e70762
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glioma represent one of the most prevalent and lethal malignancies 
      within the central nervous system. Recent studies have identified ITPRIPL1, a 
      newly reported CD3ε-inhibitory ligand, as a suppressor of T cell activation, 
      thereby facilitating tumor immune evasion and offering a novel avenue for 
      immunotherapeutic intervention in glioma. METHODS: A comprehensive analysis was 
      performed using datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Chinese Glioma 
      Genome Atlas (CGGA), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). This included evaluating 
      ITPRIPL1 expression levels in glioma, its association with clinicopathological 
      features, prognostic significance, immune landscape, targeted drug sensitivity, 
      and underlying biological functions. Ninety-eight machine learning algorithm 
      combinations were screened to identify the optimal predictive model. A nomogram 
      was subsequently constructed and validated to assess the integrated prognostic 
      impact of ITPRIPL1 expression on glioma patients. RESULTS: Elevated ITPRIPL1 
      expression was positively correlated with higher tumor grade and poorer clinical 
      outcomes. Immune infiltration profiling revealed that ITPRIPL1 expression was 
      negatively associated with effector memory CD4⁺ T cells and type 17 T helper 
      cells (Th17), but positively correlated with M2-polarized macrophages and several 
      immune checkpoint molecules. Moreover, drug sensitivity analyses and molecular 
      docking studies highlighted a potential therapeutic relationship between ITPRIPL1 
      and antitumor agents such as AZD8055. The SuperPC model emerged as the most 
      robust predictor and was utilized to develop a prognostic nomogram capable of 
      reliably forecasting survival in glioma patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals 
      that ITPRIPL1 plays a dual role in glioma: It suppresses T cell-mediated immune 
      responses, contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment, and interferes 
      with the efficacy of antitumor drugs, thereby promoting tumor progression and 
      ultimately leading to poor patient prognosis.

AB  - Macrophage polarization plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and plaque 
      stability of atherosclerosis (AS). In response to microenvironmental cues, 
      macrophages differentiate into pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 
      phenotypes, which respectively exacerbate or mitigate inflammatory responses and 
      influence plaque progression. Emerging evidence highlights the therapeutic 
      potential of targeting macrophage polarization through signaling pathways such as 
      Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ), Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer 
      and activator of transcription (STAT), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein 
      kinase B (Akt) pathway, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. 
      Bioactive metabolites derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-including 
      ginsenosides (e.g., Rb1, Rg3), berberine (BBR), curcumin (CUR), and tanshinone 
      IIA (Tan IIA)-as well as herbal formulas like Bu Yang Huan Wu Decoction (BYHW) 
      and Zhuyu Pill (ZYP), have demonstrated efficacy in promoting M2 polarization and 
      suppressing M1 phenotypes, thereby attenuating AS. This review critically 
      synthesizes the current body of evidence, with a primary focus on preclinical 
      studies (in vitro and in vivo), which comprehensively synthesizes evidence on the 
      targeted modulation of AS-associated macrophage polarization by bioactive 
      metabolites and herbal formulas, with a unique emphasis on the role of TCM as a 
      multi-target regulator of macrophage plasticity. This approach provides novel 
      perspectives for the prevention and treatment of AS.

TI  - Prevalence and Associations of Beta2-Microglobulin Mutations in MSI-H/dMMR 
      Cancers.
PG  - e136-e144
LID - 10.1093/oncolo/oyac268 [doi]
AB  - Microsatellite instability (MSI) has emerged as an important predictor of 
      sensitivity for immunotherapy-based strategies. β-2-Microglobulin (B2M) contains 
      microsatellites within the coding regions and is prone to somatic changes in 
      MSI/mismatch repair deficiency (MSI/dMMR) tumors. To delineate prevalence and 
      associations of B2M mutations in MSI-H/dMMR cancers, we investigated the 
      mutational profile of B2M and clinical and pathological features in gastric 
      cancer (GC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and endometrial cancer (EC) with a high 
      incidence of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/dMMR. Formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues along with matched normal tissues were 
      collected from 108 MSI/dMMR patients with GC, CRC, and EC. Genomic profiling of 
      tissue and blood samples were assessed next-generation sequencing (NGS). 
      Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to examine the presence or absence of B2M 
      protein. Alternations in the exonic microsatellite regions of B2M were observed 
      at various but high frequencies (57.5% in CRC, 23.9% in GC, and 13.6% in EC) and 
      in different forms. NGS assay revealed that genes involved in chromatin 
      regulation, the PI3K pathway, the WNT pathway, and mismatch repair were 
      extensively altered in the MSI-H cohort. Signature 6 and 26, 2 of 4 mutational 
      signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair, featured with high 
      numbers of small insertion/deletions (INDEL) dominated in all 3 types of cancer. 
      Alternations in the exonic microsatellite regions of B2M were observed at various 
      but high frequencies (57.5% in CRC, 23.9% in GC, and 13.6% in EC) and in 
      different forms. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was significantly higher in the 
      patients carrying MSI-H/dMMR tumors with B2M mutation than that in patients with 
      wild-type B2M (P = .026).The frame shift alteration occurring at the exonic 
      microsatellite sties caused loss of function of B2M gene. In addition, a case 
      with CRC carrying indels in B2M gene resisted the ICI treatment was reported. In 
      conclusion, patients carrying MSI-H/dMMR tumors with B2M mutation showed 
      significantly higher TMB. Prescription of ICIs should be thoroughly evaluated for 
      these patients.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an underwater object detection method using monocular 
      vision sensors. In addition to commonly used visual features such as color and 
      intensity, we investigate the potential of underwater object detection using 
      light transmission information. The global contrast of various features is used 
      to initially identify the region of interest (ROI), which is then filtered by the 
      image segmentation method, producing the final underwater object detection 
      results. We test the performance of our method with diverse underwater datasets. 
      Samples of the datasets are acquired by a monocular camera with different 
      qualities (such as resolution and focal length) and setups (viewing distance, 
      viewing angle, and optical environment). It is demonstrated that our ROI 
      detection method is necessary and can largely remove the background noise and 
      significantly increase the accuracy of our underwater object detection method.

AB  - Globally, approximately one-third of ischemic heart diseases are due to 
      hyperlipidemia, which has been shown to cause various metabolic disorders. This 
      study was aimed to disassemble and analyze hypolipidemic formulae sold by 
      traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pharmacies. Using commonly used statistical 
      parameters in ethnopharmacology, we identified the core drug combination of the 
      hypolipidemic formulae, thereby exploring the strategy by which the Taiwanese 
      people select hypolipidemic drugs. Most important of all, we preserved the 
      inherited knowledge of TCM. We visited 116 TCM pharmacies in Taiwan and collected 
      91 TCM formulae. The formulae were mainly disassembled by macroscopical 
      identification, and the medicinal materials with a relative frequency of citation 
      (RFC) >0.2 were defined as commonly used medicinal materials. Subsequently, we 
      sorted the information of medicinal materials recorded in the Pharmacopeia, 
      searched for modern pharmacological research on commonly used medicinal materials 
      using PubMed database, and visualized data based on the statistical results. 
      Finally, the core hypolipidemic medicinal materials used in folk medicine were 
      obtained. Of the 91 TCM formulae collected in this study, 80 traditional Chinese 
      medicinal materials were used, belonging to 43 families, predominantly Lamiaceae. 
      Roots were the most commonly used part as a medicinal material. There were 17 
      commonly used medicinal materials. Based on medicinal records in Pharmacopeia, 
      most flavors and properties were warm and pungent, the majority traditional 
      effects were "tonifying and replenishing" and "blood-regulating." Besides, the 
      targeted diseases searching from modern pharmacological studies were diabetes 
      mellitus and dyslipidemia. The core medicinal materials consisted of Astragalus 
      mongholicus Bunge and Crataegus pinnatifida Bunge, and the core formulae were 
      Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu-Tang and Xie-Fu-Zhu-Yu-Tang. In addition, 7 groups of folk 
      misused medicinal materials were found. Although these TCMs have been used for a 
      long period of time, their hypolipidemic mechanisms remain unclear, and further 
      studies are needed to validate their safety and efficacy.

TI  - Traditional Chinese medicine as supportive care for the management of liver 
      cancer: Past, present, and future.

AB  - Liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading 
      cause of cancer death worldwide. Western medicine and therapies are the primary 
      treatment strategies of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the general prognosis 
      for HCC patients is still dismal. Under these circumstances, HCC prevention is 
      particularly important. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) encompasses a wealth 
      of documented therapeutic resources, and "preventative treatment" is the 
      principle of TCM. In China, TCM has been used for HCC prevention for thousands of 
      years, and has also been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of HCC in 
      modern China. However, the TCM theory for prevention and treatment of HCC is more 
      widely accepted in China than abroad. In this review, we first summarize the 
      herbs and ancient formulas with therapeutic effects on HCC. We also review the 
      research status of TCM in modern medicine as well as the current obstacles in its 
      development. Finally, we discuss the future of TCM in the context of precision 
      and integrated medicine. After reviewing the literature, we believe that TCM, 
      through ancient development, is an advanced method of cancer treatment with 
      positive curative effects, despite its surrounding controversy. Furthermore, 
      precise analyses and systematic research methods provides novel approaches to 
      modernize TCM for the future.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the positive effects of Bu Shen Huo Xue 
      Decoction (BSHXF) on assisted reproduction. The study aimed to evaluate whether 
      BSHXD could improve endometrial morphology and increase the expression of LIF in 
      a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) long protocol-induced rat 
      model during metestrus, diestrus, proestrus, and oestrus. The BSHXD group 
      presented significantly increased endometrium thickness and decreased MVD 
      compared with the GnRHa long protocol group. In addition, the expression of LIF 
      was significantly higher in the BSHXD group. There were no significant 
      differences between the control group and the BSHXD group in terms of MVD and LIF 
      expression. These results suggested that BSHXD can improve the endometrium 
      development, reduce the abnormal angiogenesis, and increase the expression of 
      receptivity markers in a GnRHa long protocol-induced rat model during the 
      oestrous cycle, which might result in an endometrial environment better suited 
      for female reproduction.

TI  - Mendelian Randomization and Bioinformatics Analysis Reveal the Potential 
      Protective Role of Metformin in Primary Liver Cancer.
PG  - e71156
LID - 10.1002/fsn3.71156 [doi]
LID - e71156
AB  - Primary liver cancer (PLC) and metformin are not well understood to be 
      associated. We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genetic 
      data from IEU OpenGWAS and FinnGen R10, with metformin as the exposure and PLC as 
      the outcome. The inverse variance weighting (IVW) method was the primary 
      analytical approach, with heterogeneity assessed by Cochran's Q test, pleiotropy 
      by MR-Egger intercept, and outliers by MR-PRESSO. Bioinformatics analyses further 
      explored potential mechanisms, including differential gene expression, 
      protein-protein interactions (PPI), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
      Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses, immune cell infiltration analysis, 
      and drug sensitivity analysis. MR results demonstrated a significant association 
      between metformin use and reduced risk of PLC (β = -5.6046, OR = 0.0037, 
      p = 0.026), with a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p value 
      of 0.13. However, no causal effect was observed for hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). By cross-referencing 
      transcriptome data from the GEO database GSE241466 with metformin-related gene 
      loci, 34 overlapping genes were identified. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
      were filtered using |log2FC| > 0 and p < 0.05, with five hub genes (DDX52, KIF11, 
      GCDH, MRPL45, and TICRR) being particularly prominent. Functional enrichment 
      analysis revealed involvement in cGMP-PKG signaling and fatty acid metabolism 
      pathways. Further validation with GEPIA2, TIMER, and TISCH showed correlations 
      between these genes and immune infiltration, while GSCA-based drug sensitivity 
      analysis suggested therapeutic relevance. In summary, these findings indicate 
      that metformin may reduce PLC risk by modulating metabolic and immune-related 
      pathways, supporting its potential value as an adjunct therapeutic agent. 
      However, further validation through large-scale clinical and basic research is 
      warranted.

AB  - Improving the activity and stability of enzymes is significant in enzyme 
      immobilization. Here a facile approach to prepare ring-like ZIF-8 colloidosomes 
      and spherical catalase-embedded ZIF-8 colloidosomes is developed via one-step 
      emulsion-based technique at the water/butanol interface. The influence of the 
      concentrations of ZIF-8 nanocrystals and Pluronic F127 as well as the oil-water 
      ratio was investigated. Compared with in situ biomineralization, the 
      colloidosomes prepared via the pickering emulsion method show successful 
      encapsulation of positively charged enzymes. By using catalase as an immobilized 
      model, the immobilized catalase exhibits high biocatalytic activity, stability 
      and recyclability compared with free catalase.

TI  - BYHW Decoction Improves Cognitive Impairments in Rats with Cerebral Microinfarcts 
      via Activation of the PKA/CREB Pathway.
PG  - 4455654
LID - 10.1155/2022/4455654 [doi]
LID - 4455654
AB  - Cerebral microinfarcts (CMIs) are characterized by sporadic obstruction of small 
      vessels leading to neurons death. They are associated with increased risk of 
      cognitive impairments and may have different risk factors compared with 
      macroinfarcts. CMIs have a high incidence and result in heavy social burden; 
      thus, it is essential to provide reasonable treatment in clinical practice. 
      However, there are relatively few researches on the mechanism and treatment of 
      CMIs, and the literature is composed almost exclusively of community-or hospital 
      based on autopsy or imageological studies focusing on elderly patients. The Bu 
      Yang Huan Wu (BYHW) decoction, a traditional Chinese herbal formula, has long 
      been used to treat stroke and stroke-related diseases, including cognitive 
      impairments. We applied microsphere-induced CMI model in rats to investigate the 
      behavioral and molecular consequences of CMIs and to determine how they were 
      ameliorated by BYHW decoction treatment. We then used the Morris water maze, 
      quantitative proteomics, immunohistochemistry, and other molecular assays and 
      found that activation of the PKA/CREB pathway by BYHW decoction treatment may 
      reverse mitochondrial dysfunction, inhibit apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, and 
      ameliorate CMI-induced cognitive impairments in rats. Collectively, these 
      findings confirmed the therapeutic potential of the BYHW decoction in treating 
      cognitive impairments induced by CMIs and demonstrated a viable mechanism for its 
      action.

      mortality after AMI, the incidence of HF after AMI and the resulting risk of 
      death are still rising, which causes difficulties in the rehabilitation of AMI 
      patients after reperfusion. METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, 
      randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled trial, we will 
      assigned 673 eligible patients with AMI after reperfusion into 4 groups: 
      receiving Nao-Xin-Tong capsule (NXT), Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu (BYHW) granule (BYHW), 
      Yang-Yin-Tong-Nao granule (YYTN), or placebo. The course of treatment will be 3 
      months. The primary outcome is HF incidence within 180 days. Nao-Xin-Tong 
      capsule, BYHW granule, and Yang-Yin-Tong-Nao granule are different traditional 
      Chinese medicines used for tonifying Qi and activating blood (TQAB). RESULTS: 
      Three months of TQAB combined with Western medicine may reduce the incidence of 
      HF after reperfusion of AMI and improve patients' quality of life. DISCUSSION: 
      This study will provide an important basis for the application of traditional 
      Chinese medicine in patients with AMI after reperfusion and provide an 
      evidence-based basis for the prevention and treatment strategy of HF after AMI.

TI  - Traditional chinese medicine treatment of epilepsy.
PG  - 673-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine, 
      specifically the traditional herbal formulation Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang, for 
      treating epilepsy stemming from cerebrovascular dysfunction. SUBJECTS: Three 
      adult patients with epilepsy refractory to standard antiepileptic medications 
      were involved. RESULTS: All three showed substantial improvement in the frequency 
      and severity of seizures after Bu-yanghuan- wu-tang was added to conventional 
      medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Decrease of seizure frequency and severity in 
      three epileptic patients was achieved by adding Bu-yang-huan-wu-tang to 
      conventional therapy according to the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine 
      (TCM) theory. This treatment mainly relied on the resolution of blood stagnation 
      in cerebrovascular systems. Blood stagnation is an important underlying pathology 
      of many disease processes according to TCM theory.

TI  - Continuous-flow label-free size fractionation of extracellular vesicles through 
      electrothermal fluid rolls and dielectrophoresis synergistically integrated in a 
      microfluidic device.
PG  - 2421-2433
LID - 10.1039/d2lc01193j [doi]
AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived bioparticles that play significant 
      roles in various biological processes including cell-to-cell communication and 
      intercellular delivery. Additionally, they hold great potential as liquid biopsy 
      biomarkers for pre-diagnostic applications. However, the isolation of EV 
      subpopulations, especially exosomes from a biological fluid remains a challenge 
      due to their submicron range. Here, we demonstrate continuous-flow label-free 
      size fractionation of EVs for the first time through a synergistic combination of 
      electrothermal fluid rolls and dielectrophoresis in a microfluidic device. The 
      device features three dimensional microelectrodes with unique sidewall contours 
      that give rise to effective electrothermal fluid rolls in cooperation with 
      dielectrophoretic forces for the electrokinetic manipulation and size separation 
      of submicron particles. We first validate the device functionality by separating 
      submicron polystyrene particles from binary mixtures with a cut-off size of ∼200 
      nm and then isolate intact exosomes from cell culture medium or blood serum with 
      a high recovery rate and purity (∼80%). The device operation in a 
      high-conductivity medium renders the method ideal for the purification of target 
      bioparticles directly from physiological fluids, and may offer a robust and 
      versatile platform for EV related diagnostic applications.

TI  - Can medical herbs stimulate regeneration or neuroprotection and treat neuropathic 
      pain in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy?
PG  - 423713

LID - 423713
AB  - Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIPN) has a relevant impact on the quality of 
      life of cancer patients. There are no curative conventional treatments, so 
      further options have to be investigated. We conducted a systematic review in 
      English and Chinese language databases to illuminate the role of medical herbs. 
      26 relevant studies on 5 single herbs, one extract, one receptor-agonist, and 8 
      combinations of herbs were identified focusing on the single herbs Acorus calamus 
      rhizoma, Cannabis sativa fructus, Chamomilla matricaria, Ginkgo biloba, Salvia 
      officinalis, Sweet bee venom, Fritillaria cirrhosae bulbus, and the herbal 
      combinations Bu Yang Huan Wu, modified Bu Yang Huan Wu plus Liuwei Di Huang, 
      modified Chai Hu Long Gu Mu Li Wan, Geranii herba plus Aconiti lateralis 
      praeparata radix , Niu Che Sen Qi Wan (Goshajinkigan), Gui Zhi Jia Shu Fu Tang 
      (Keishikajutsubuto), Huang Qi Wu Wu Tang (Ogikeishigomotsuto), and Shao Yao Gan 
      Cao Tang (Shakuyakukanzoto). The knowledge of mechanism of action is still 
      limited, the quality of clinical trials needs further improvement, and studies 
      have not yielded enough evidence to establish a standard practice, but a lot of 
      promising substances have been identified. While CIPN has multiple mechanisms of 
      neuronal degeneration, a combination of herbs or substances might deal with 
      multiple targets for the aim of neuroprotection or neuroregeneration in CIPN.

TI  - High precision wavefront correction method in interferometer testing.
PG  - 24480-24497
LID - 10.1364/OE.526063 [doi]
AB  - A wavefront correction method is proposed for high-precision optic surfacing, 
      addressing the discrepancy between wavefront and real surface errors in Fizeau 
      interferometer testing. We believe this to be a proposed novel method that 
      encompasses optical surface function parameters fitting, lateral distortion 
      correction, misalignment error removal, and sag surface error calculation. The 
      method's error has been thoroughly analyzed, including aspects of function 
      parameters fitting, ray tracing, and interpolation. The effectiveness of the 
      method was demonstrated by correcting the wavefront of an off-axis parabolic 
      mirror in null testing configurations, significantly reducing artificially 
      created annular errors and improving off-axis direction errors from 0.23λ to 
      0.05λ (λ=632.8 nm), with the PV of aspheric departures exceeding 8.5 mm.

TI  - Endoscopic Ruler for varix size measurement: A multicenter pilot study.
PG  - 564-573
LID - 10.4253/wjge.v15.i9.564 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We invented Endoscopic Ruler, a new endoscopic device to measure the 
      size of varices in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. AIM: To 
      assess the feasibility and safety of Endoscopic Ruler, and evaluate the agreement 
      on identifying large oesophageal varices (OV) between Endoscopic Ruler and the 
      endoscopists, as well as the interobserver agreement on diagnosing large OV using 
      Endoscopic Ruler. METHODS: We prospectively and consecutively enrolled patients 
      with cirrhosis from 11 hospitals, all of whom got esophagogastroduodenoscopy 
      (EGD) with Endoscopic Ruler. The primary study outcome was a successful 
      measurement of the size of varices using Endoscopic Ruler. The secondary outcomes 
      included adverse events, operation time, the agreement of identifying large OV 
      between the objective measurement of Endoscopic Ruler and the empirical reading 
      of endoscopists, together with the interobserver agreement on diagnosing large OV 
      by Endoscopic Ruler. RESULTS: From November 2020 to April 2022, a total of 120 
      eligible patients with cirrhosis were recruited and all of them underwent EGD 
      examinations with Endoscopic Ruler successfully without any adverse event. The 
      median operation time of Endoscopic Ruler was 3.00 min [interquartile range 
      (IQR): 3.00 min]. The kappa value between Endoscopic Ruler and the endoscopists 
      while detecting large OV was 0.52, demonstrating a moderate agreement. The kappa 
      value for diagnosing large OV using Endoscopic Ruler among the six independent 
      observers was 0.77, demonstrating a substantial agreement. CONCLUSION: The data 
      demonstrates that Endoscopic Ruler is feasible and safe for measuring the size of 
      varices in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Endoscopic Ruler is 
      potential to promote the clinical practice of the two-grade classification system 
      of OV.

TI  - High-Performance Gel-Free and Label-Free Size Fractionation of Extracellular 
      Vesicles with Two-Dimensional Electrophoresis in a Microfluidic Artificial Sieve.
PG  - 3508-3516
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.3c05290 [doi]
AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived particles that exhibit diverse 
      sizes, molecular contents, and clinical implications for various diseases 
      depending on their specific subpopulations. However, fractionation of EV 
      subpopulations with high resolution, efficiency, purity, and yield remains an 
      elusive goal due to their diminutive sizes. In this study, we introduce a novel 
      strategy that effectively separates EV subpopulations in a gel-free and 
      label-free manner, using two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis in a microfluidic 
      artificial sieve. The microfabricated artificial sieve consists of periodically 
      arranged micro-slit-well structures in a 2D array and generates an anisotropic 
      electric field pattern to size fractionate EVs into discrete streams and steer 
      the subpopulations into designated outlets for collection within a minute. Along 
      with fractionating EV subpopulations, contaminants such as free proteins and 
      short nucleic acids can be simultaneously directed to waste outlets, thus 
      accomplishing both size fractionation and purification of EVs with high 
      performance. Our platform offers a simple, rapid, and versatile solution for EV 
      subpopulation isolation, which can potentially facilitate the discovery of 
      biomarkers for specific EV subtypes and the development of EV-based therapeutics.

AB  - Anillin actin-binding protein (ANLN) is crucially involved in cell proliferation 
      and migration. Moreover, ANLN is significantly in tumor progression in several 
      types of human malignant tumors; however, it remains unclear whether ANLN acts 
      through common molecular pathways within different tumor microenvironments, 
      pathogeneses, prognoses and immunotherapy contexts. Therefore, this study aimed 
      to perform bioinformatics analysis to examine the correlation of ANLN with tumor 
      immune infiltration, immune evasion, tumor progression, immunotherapy, and tumor 
      prognosis. We observed increased ANLN expression in multiple tumors, which could 
      be involved in tumor cell proliferation, migration, infiltration, and prognosis. 
      The level of ANLN methylation and genetic alteration was associated with 
      prognosis in numerous tumors. ANLN facilitates tumor immune evasion through 
      different mechanisms, which involve T-cell exclusion in different cancer types 
      and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in colon adenocarcinoma, kidney renal clear 
      cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma. 
      Additionally, ANLN is correlated with immune or chemotherapeutic outcomes in 
      malignant cancers. Notably, ANLN expression may be a predictive biomarker for the 
      response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Taken together, our findings suggest 
      that ANLN can be used as an onco-immunological biomarker and could serve as a 
      hallmark for tumor screening, prognosis, individualized treatment design, and 
      follow-up.

TI  - Accelerated Electrophoretic Focusing and Purification of DNA Based on Synchronous 
      Coefficient of Drag Alteration.
PG  - 16453-16458
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.3c03632 [doi]
AB  - Synchronous coefficient of drag alteration refers to a multidimensional transport 
      mechanism where a net drift of molecules is achieved under a zero-time-average 
      alternating motive force by perturbing their drag coefficient synchronously with 
      the applied force. An electrophoretic form of the method is often applied to 
      focus and purify nucleic acids in a gel under rotating electric fields. However, 
      this method requires lengthy operation due to the use of limited field strengths. 
      Here, using DNA as target molecules, we demonstrate that the operation time can 
      be reduced from hours to minutes by replacing polymer gel with a microfabricated 
      artificial sieve. We also describe an electrophoretic protocol that facilitates 
      the collection of purified DNA from the sieve, which is shown to yield 
      amplifiable DNA from crude samples including the lysates of cultured cells and 
      whole blood. The sieve can be further equipped with nucleic acid amplification 
      and detection functions for a point-of-care diagnostic application.

      miR-204-3p/KRAS.
PG  - 12007-12015
LID - 10.18632/aging.202905 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) participate in tumor development and tumorigenesis. 
      However, the mechanism, function and expression of LINC00514 in GC remain 
      unknown. We showed that LINC00514 was upregulated in GC specimens compared with 
      nontumor specimens. Overexpression of LINC00514 induced cell growth and EMT 
      progression in GC cells. By using bioinformatics prediction, we found that 
      miR-204-3p contained binding sequences for LINC00514. Luciferase reporter 
      analysis noted that miR-204-3p overexpression decreased the luciferase expression 
      under LINC00514-wild-type and KRAS-wild-type reporters but not that under mutant 
      reporter. Ectopic LINC00514 expression decreased miR-204-3p expression. 
      miR-204-3p expression was decreased in GC specimens compared with nontumor 
      specimens and that LINC00514 was negatively correlated with miR-204-3p in GC 
      specimens. Furthermore, KRAS was identified as a target gene for miR-204-3p 
      according to TargetScan. Elevated miR-204-3p expression inhibited KRAS expression 
      in HGC-27 cells, and ectopic expression of LINC00514 enhanced KRAS expression. 
      Elevated LINC00514 expression enhanced cell growth and EMT progression by 
      sponging KRAS. Our data indicated that LINC00514 may act as an oncogene and 
      therapeutic target for GC.

TI  - Beneficial effects and safety of traditional Chinese medicine for chronic 
      inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy: A case report and literature 
      review.

LID - 1126444
AB  - Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an 
      immune-mediated neuropathy. First-line treatments for CIDP include 
      corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange. However, the 
      application is always limited by high costs, effectiveness, and adverse events. 
      This study investigated a new potentially effective and safe therapeutic 
      treatment to alleviate CIDP symptoms and improve the quality of life. In the 
      present case, a 47-year-old rural woman presented with weakness and numbness of 
      progressive extremities. She was diagnosed with CIDP based on abnormal 
      cerebrospinal fluid and electromyography. The patient was treated with 
      intravenous dexamethasone for 1 week and with Huangqi-Guizhi-Wuwu and 
      Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu decoctions for 90 days. Surprisingly, after the treatment, the 
      weakness and numbness were eliminated, and the quality of life improved. The 
      varying INCAT, MRC, and BI scores also reflected the treatment effects. After 8 
      months of discharge, the symptoms did not relapse during the follow-up. We also 
      searched "traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)" and "CIDP" in PubMed, EMBASE, the 
      Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Chinese National Knowledge 
      Infrastructure Databases, Wanfang Data, and the Chongqing Chinese Science and 
      Technology Periodical Database. Finally, only ten studies were included in the 
      literature review. Three studies were randomized controlled trials, and seven 
      were case reports or case series. There were 419 CIDP patients, but all study 
      sites were in China. Nine TCM formulas involving 44 herbs were reported, with 
      Huang Qi (Astragalus membranaceus) being the most important herb. In conclusion, 
      the case and literature demonstrated that TCM treatment might be a more 
      effective, low-cost, and safe option for treating CIDP. Although these 
      preliminary findings are promising, a larger sample size and higher-quality 
      randomized clinical trials are urgently required to confirm our findings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of preterm birth associated with mode of delivery 
      in a previous pregnancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter 
      retrospective cohort study. Women who had two consecutive deliveries in the 
      participating hospitals between January 2012 and January 2022 were included in 
      this study. They were divided into three groups according to the mode of delivery 
      in a previous pregnancy: vaginal birth (group A), cesarean section before the 
      second stage of labor (group B), and second stage cesarean section (group C). 
      Data were extracted from the medical records. The primary outcome was the risk of 
      spontaneous preterm birth in the subsequent pregnancy. The secondary outcomes 
      were the risk of early spontaneous preterm birth (< 34 weeks) and the medically 
      indicated preterm birth in the subsequent pregnancy. The logistic regression was 
      employed to estimate odds and adjust for confounders. RESULTS: 18,253 women were 
      included. Among them, 10,951 women were in group A, 5111 women in group B, and 
      2191 women in group C. The rates of spontaneous preterm birth in groups A, B, and 
      C were 5.5%, 7.3%, and 15.1%, respectively. The rates of early spontaneous 
      preterm birth in groups A, B, and C were 2.3%, 3.4%, and 8.2%, respectively. When 
      compared with vaginal birth, second-stage cesarean section significantly 
      increased the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (aOR, 3.23; 95% CI, 2.02-5.17; 
      P = 0.003) and early spontaneous preterm birth (aOR, 3.59; 95% CI, 2.01-5.19; P 
      <0.001) in the subsequent pregnancy. The rates of medically indicated preterm 
      birth in groups A, B, and C were 2.3%, 2.8%, and 2.2%, respectively. There was no 
      statistical difference across the three groups. CONCLUSION: History of cesarean 
      section at full dilation is independently associated with an increased risk of 
      spontaneous preterm birth in the subsequent pregnancy.

TI  - A nanofluidic memristor based on ion concentration polarization.
PG  - 7168-7172
LID - 10.1039/c9an01561b [doi]
AB  - This paper reports the very first nanofluidic memristor based on the principle of 
      ion concentration polarization (ICP). ICP is induced through highly-ordered 
      cylindrical nanochannels. These so-called nanocapillaries are formed within a 
      glass layer on silicon through a thermal reflow process and low-resolution 
      lithography. The current-voltage plots exhibit characteristic pinched-hysteresis 
      loops and the concurrent tracking of fluorescent charged particles correlates the 
      memristive behaviour to the ICP. The ICP-based nanofluidic memristor could have 
      implications in emerging areas such as integrated fluid-based logic circuits.

TI  - Fast thermal aberration model for lithographic projection lenses.
PG  - 34038-34049
LID - 10.1364/OE.27.034038 [doi]
AB  - A novel fast thermal aberration model for lithographic projection lenses is 
      proposed. In the model, optical intensity calculation is simplified by using 
      pupil intensity mapping, and simplified formulas for temperature calculation are 
      derived to realize fast simulation of thermal aberration. The simulation results 
      using the proposed model are compared with that of experiments carried out on a 
      commercial lithography tool. The R-square of the simulation is better than 0.99 
      and the simulation time is about 10 minutes. Experiments and simulations show 
      that the model is capable of predicting the thermal aberration or the variation 
      trend of the thermal aberration of lithographic projection lenses fast and 
      accurately. The model is applicable in projection lens design, evaluating degree 
      of production risk posed by thermal aberration, etc.

TI  - SIRT1 Inhibition-Induced Mitochondrial Damage Promotes GSDME-Dependent Pyroptosis 
      in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.
PG  - 3628-3639
LID - 10.1007/s12033-023-00964-z [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor that affects the liver and 
      poses a significant threat to human health. Further investigation is necessary to 
      fully understand the role of SIRT1, a protein linked to tumorigenesis, in HCC 
      development. To investigate the effect of SIRT1 on HCC and elucidate the 
      underlying mechanism. Eight pairs of HCC and paracancerous normal tissue 
      specimens were collected. The levels of SIRT1 and GSDME in tissue samples were 
      assessed using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. SIRT1 levels were 
      determined in HCC (Huh7, HepG2, SNU-423, SNU-398, and HCCLM3) and L-02 cells 
      using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and 
      western blotting. SNU-423 and HCCLM3 cells were transfected with si-SIRT1 and/or 
      si-GSDME to knock down SIRT1 or GSDME expression. RT-qPCR and western blotting 
      were performed to measure the expression of SIRT1, pro-casp-3, cl-casp-3, GSDME, 
      GSDME-N, PGC-1α, Bax, and cytochrome c (Cyto C). Cell proliferation, migration, 
      invasion, and apoptosis were assessed using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 
      wound healing assay, Transwell invasion assay, and flow cytometry, respectively. 
      The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was evaluated using an LDH kit. SIRT1 
      was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells, and a negative correlation was observed 
      between SIRT1 and GSDME-N. SIRT1 silencing suppressed the proliferation, 
      migration, and invasion of HCC cells while also promoting apoptosis and inducing 
      mitochondrial damage. Additionally, the silencing of SIRT1 resulted in the 
      formation of large bubbles on the plasma membrane of HCC cells, leading to 
      cellular swelling and aggravated GSDME-dependent pyroptosis, resulting in an 
      increase in LDH release. Inhibition of GSDME reduced SIRT1 silencing-induced cell 
      swelling, decreased LDH release rate, and promoted apoptosis. SIRT1 silencing 
      promotes GSDME-dependent pyroptosis in HCC cells by damaging mitochondria.

TI  - Transport properties of paeoniflorin and amygdalin across caco-2 cell monolayer 
      model and their modulation of cytochrome p450 metabolism.
PG  - 1569-1575
AB  - Paeoniflorin and amygdalin are two major active saponins constituents in some 
      Chinese herbal formulas used for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. However, their 
      intestinal absorption property and metabolic characteristics have not been 
      clarified. The aim of this work was to study the absorption property of 
      Paeoniflorin and Amygdalin across Caco-2 cell monolayer and their metabolic 
      characteristics on the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme. The results 
      showed that the transport amount of Paeoniflorin and Amygdalin was positively 
      correlated with the time and concentrations, and the transport amount from AP 
      side to BL side was higher than that from BL to AP. The absorptions of 
      Paeoniflorin and Amygdalin were reduced by P-glycoprotein, which provided the 
      pharmacokinetic basis for their clinical application. Furthermore, we 
      demonstrated that Paeoniflorin and Amygdalin had obvious inhibiting effects on 
      CYP2C9 and CYP2E1. The transports of Paeoniflorin and Amygdalin across Caco-2 
      cell monolayer model were deduced as the passive transport, which indicated that 
      the present bioassay system was appropriate and reliable for the evaluation of 
      the transport characteristics and metabolic characteristics of active ingredient 
      groups in Bu-yang-huan-wu decoction. Moreover, this research method may also be 
      suitable for the appropriate bioactivity and metabolic characteristics analysis 
      of other plant extracts.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between fasting blood glucose (FBG) 
      and carotid intimamedia thickness (IMT) in premenopausal and postmenopausal 
      women. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study enrolled 2,959 women seen at the Maanshan 
      People's Hospital of Anhui Province from December 2013 to December 2018. Carotid 
      IMT was measured using Doppler ultrasound. Linear regression and R smoothing 
      curves were used to analyze the relationship between blood glucose level and 
      carotid IMT in the premenopausal and postmenopausal groups. RESULTS: 
      Postmenopausal compared with premenopausal women had higher mean IMT (mIMT; 0.81 
      ± 0.23 mm versus 0.70 ± 0.14 mm, respectively, p < 0.001) and maximum IMT 
      (maxIMT; 0.86 ± 0.35 mm versus 0.74 ± 0.16 mm, respectively, p < 0.001) values. 
      On linear regression analysis, mIMT values increased with increasing FBG values 
      when FBG level was ≤ 7 mmol/L, but no significance was found between FBG and 
      maxIMT. After stratification by menopausal status, mIMT and maxIMT increased with 
      increasing FBG when FBG was ≤ 7 mmol/L in the premenopausal group. In the 
      postmenopausal group, mIMT and maxIMT increased with increasing FBG. After 
      adjustment for covariate factors, the relationship between FBG and mIMT remained 
      the same as before the adjustment, but when FBG was ≤ 11 mmol/L, the maxIMT 
      increased with increasing FBG. In the stratification analysis, maxIMT increased 
      with increasing FBG when FBG was ≤ 7 mmol/L in the premenopausal group, while 
      both mIMT and maxIMT increased with increasing FBG when FBG was > 10 mmol/L in 
      the postmenopausal group. CONCLUSION: Levels of FBG contributed more to increased 
      IMT in postmenopausal than premenopausal women. The influence of FBG was greater 
      on maxIMT than mIMT. Additionally, FBG was helpful in assessing focal thickening 
      of the carotid intima.

TI  - Simultaneous determination and pharmacokinetics of protein unbound aspirin and 
      salicylic acid in rat blood and brain by microdialysis: an application to 
      herbal-drug interaction.
PG  - 31-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jchromb.2012.03.010 [doi]
AB  - Aspirin is commonly used for the prevention of myocardial infarction and ischemic 
      stroke; whereas the Chinese people employ the bu-yang-huan-wu-tang (BYHWT) as a 
      routine herbal formulation for the treatment and prevention of transient ischemic 
      stroke. The current study develops a microdialysis technique coupled to a 
      validated liquid chromatography system to measure free-form aspirin and salicylic 
      acid for herbal-drug interaction in rat blood and brain. The intra- and inter-day 
      precisions in biological dialysates were within 0.1-9.4% in the concentration 
      ranges of 0.1-50 μg/mL and the accuracies ranged from -4.7 to 6.1%. The 
      pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that the area under the concentration time curve 
      (AUC) of the aspirin was 2031 ± 266 min μg/mL after aspirin administration 
      (100mg/kg, i.v.). The AUC of salicylic acid was 12660 ± 1799 min μg/mL, which 
      suggests that aspirin is quickly hydrolyzed to salicylic acid in blood and the 
      metabolite can also be detected within 15 min in brain dialysate. The herbal-drug 
      pharmacokinetic interaction showed no significant effect in blood and brain. The 
      results of pharmacodynamics for the bleeding time suggested that there were no 
      significant differences between the aspirin alone group and the BYHWT pretreated 
      group. However, the bleeding time has been prolonged when compared aspirin alone 
      or the group pretreated with BYHWT to the blank control. The conclusion provides 
      practical information for clinical practice for the herbal formulation BYHWT and 
      aspirin used concurrently.

TI  - A Portable, Integrated, Sample-In Result-Out Nucleic Acid Diagnostic Device for 
      Rapid and Sensitive Chikungunya Virus Detection.

LID - 663
AB  - Chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne virus that causes epidemics, is often 
      misdiagnosed due to symptom similarities with other arboviruses. Here, a portable 
      and integrated nucleic acid-based diagnostic device, which combines reverse 
      transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification and lateral-flow detection, 
      was developed. The device is simple to use, precise, equipment-free, and highly 
      sensitive, enabling rapid chikungunya virus identification. The result can be 
      obtained by the naked eye within 40 min. The assay can effectively distinguish 
      chikungunya virus from dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Zika virus, and 
      yellow fever virus with high specificity and sensitivity as low as 598.46 copies 
      mL(-1). It has many benefits for the community screening and monitoring of 
      chikungunya virus in resource-limited areas because of its effectiveness and 
      simplicity. The platform has great potential for the rapid nucleic acid detection 
      of other viruses.

AB  - Herbal medicine Semen Persicae is widely used to treat blood stasis in Chinese 
      medicine and other oriental folk medicines. Although little is known about the 
      effects of Semen Persicae and its active compounds on neuron differentiation, our 
      pilot study showed that Semen Persicae extract promoted neurite outgrowth in rat 
      dopaminergic PC12 cells. In the present study, we developed a bioactivity-guided 
      fractionation procedure for the characterization of the neurotrophic activity of 
      Semen Persicae extract. The resultant fractions were assayed for neurite 
      outgrowth in PC12 cells based on microscopic assessment. Through liquid-liquid 
      extraction and reverse phase HPLC separation, a botanical glycoside amygdalin was 
      isolated as the active compound responsible for the neurotrophic activity of 
      Semen Persicae extract. Moreover, we found that amygdalin rapidly induced the 
      activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). A specific 
      ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 attenuated the stimulatory effect of amygdalin on 
      neurite outgrowth. Taken together, amygdalin was identified as a potent 
      neurotrophic agent from Semen Persicae extract through a bioactivity-guided 
      fractional procedure. The neurotrophic activity of amygdalin may be mediated by 
      the activation of ERK1/2 pathway.

AB  - A depth-dependent dispersion compensation algorithm for enhancing the image 
      quality of the Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) is presented. 
      The dispersion related with depth in the sample is considered. Using the 
      iterative method, an analytical formula for compensating the depth-dependent 
      dispersion in the sample is obtained. We apply depth-dependent dispersion 
      compensation algorithm to process the phantom images and in vivo images. Using 
      sharpness metric based on variation coefficient to compare the results processed 
      with different dispersion compensation algorithms, we find that the 
      depth-dependent dispersion compensation algorithm can improve image quality at 
      full depth.

AB  - Hepatic steatosis is associated with various liver diseases. The main 
      pathological feature of steatosis is the excessive lipid accumulation. Ultrasound 
      has been extensively used for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis. However, most 
      ultrasound-based non-invasive methods are still not accurate enough for cases 
      with light lipid infiltration. One important reason is that the extent to which 
      lipid infiltration may affect mechanical properties of hepatocytes remains 
      unknown. In this work, we used atomic force microscope and in vitro 
      dose-dependent lipid deposition model to detect the quantitative changes of 
      mechanical properties under different degrees of steatosis in a single-cell 
      level. The results show that hepatic cells with lipid deposition can be treated 
      as linear viscoelastic materials with the power law creep compliance and 
      relaxation modulus. Further analysis showed that even slight accumulation of 
      lipid can lead to measurable decrease of stiffness and increased fluidity in 
      liver cells. The accurate detection of viscoelastic properties of hepatocytes and 
      the analysis methods may provide novel insights into hepatic steatosis grading, 
      especially in the very early stage with reversible liver lesion. The application 
      of viscoelasticity index for grading fat deposition might be a new detection 
      indicator in future clinical diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that many types of cancers are composed of 
      different cell types, including cancer stem cells (CSCs). We have previously 
      shown that the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin induced epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition, which is thought to be an important mechanism for generating CSCs. In 
      the present study, we investigate whether oxaliplatin-treated cancer tissues 
      possess characteristics of CSCs, and explore oxaliplatin resistance in these 
      tissues. METHODS: Hepatocellular carcinoma cells (MHCC97H cells) were 
      subcutaneously injected into mice to form tumors, and the mice were intravenously 
      treated with either oxaliplatin or glucose. Five weeks later, the tumors were 
      orthotopically xenografted into livers of other mice, and these mice were treated 
      with either oxaliplatin or glucose. Metastatic potential, sensitivity to 
      oxaliplatin, and expression of CSC-related markers in the xenografted tumor 
      tissues were evaluated. DNA microarrays were used to measure changes in gene 
      expression as a result of oxaliplatin treatment. Additionally, an 
      oxaliplatin-resistant cell line (MHCC97H-OXA) was established to assess 
      insulin-like growth factor 1 secretion, cell invasion, cell colony formation, 
      oxaliplatin sensitivity, and expression of CSC-related markers. The effects of an 
      insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor inhibitor were also assessed. RESULTS: 
      Oxaliplatin treatment inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth. Tumors from 
      oxaliplatin-treated mice that were subsequently xenografted into livers of other 
      mice exhibited that decreasing sensitivity to oxaliplatin and increasing 
      pulmonary metastatic potential. Among the expression of CSC-related proteins, the 
      gene for insulin-like growth factor 1, was up-regulated expecially in these tumor 
      tissues. Additionally, MHCC97H-OXA cells demonstrated that increasing cell 
      invasion, colony formation, and expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 and 
      CSC-related markers, whereas treatment with an inhibitor of the insulin-like 
      growth factor 1 receptor suppressed these effects. CONCLUSION: Maintenance of 
      stemness in oxaliplatin-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells is associated 
      with increased autocrine of IGF1.

TI  - Silver-Nanoparticle-Embedded Porous Silicon Disks Enabled SERS Signal 
      Amplification for Selective Glutathione Detection.
PG  - 410-417
LID - 10.1021/acsanm.7b00290 [doi]
AB  - As the major redox couple and nonprotein thiol source in human tissues, the level 
      of glutathione (GSH) has been a concern for its relation with many diseases. 
      However, the similar physical and chemical properties of interference molecules 
      such as cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy) make discriminative detection of 
      GSH in complex biological fluids challenging. Here we report a novel 
      surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) platform, based on 
      silver-nanoparticle-embedded porous silicon disks (PSDs/Ag) substrates for highly 
      sensitive and selective detection of GSH in biofluids. Silver nanoparticles 
      (AgNPs) were reductively synthesized and aggregated directly into pores of PSDs, 
      achieving a SERS enhancement factor (EF) up to 2.59 × 10(7). Ellman's reagent 
      5,5'-ditho-bis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) was selected as the Raman reactive 
      reporting agent, and the GSH quantification was determined using enzymatic 
      recycling method, and allowed the detection limit of GSH to be down to 74.9 nM 
      using a portable Raman spectrometer. Moreover, the significantly overwhelmed 
      enhancement ratio of GSH over other substances enables the discrimination of GSH 
      detection in complex biofluids.

TI  - Microfluidic device for the analysis of MDR cancerous cell-derived exosomes' 
      response to nanotherapy.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1007/s10544-019-0381-1 [doi]
AB  - Exosomes are membrane-enclosed extracellular vesicles which have been indicated 
      as important biomarkers of cancerous cell functionality, such as multiple drug 
      resistance (MDR). Nanoparticles based chemotherapy is a promising strategy to 
      overcome MDR by interfering the production and composition of exosomes. 
      Therefore, tumor-derived exosomes post-treatment by nanotherapy are implied to 
      play critical roles of biomarkers on cancer MDR analysis. However, the efficient 
      isolation of such exosomes from extracellular environment for their therapeutic 
      response analysis remains challenging. In this study, we presented a microfluidic 
      device featured exosome specific anti-CD63 immobilized ciliated micropillars, 
      which were capable to isolate cancer-derived exosomes from cell culture medium. 
      The captured exosomes can be recovered intact by dissolving the cilia on the 
      micropillars using PBS soaking. Owing to the immobilized antibody in the 
      microfluidic device, nearly 70% of exosome from the biofluid could be isolated. 
      So the secreted exosomes of the MDR and ordinary human breast cancer cells 
      pre-treated by free drug or nanotherapy could be isolated with high purity. The 
      drug contents of the isolated exosomes were measured to analysis of the exosomal 
      pathway response of MDR cells to different chemotherapeutic formulations. Such 
      analyses and further definition of the biomarkers of these exosomes could benefit 
      the future investigations of accurately and reliably determine design principle, 
      functional activity, and mechanisms of nanotherapy for MDR overcoming.

TI  - Numerical Investigation of Drop Impact on Immiscible Liquid-Liquid Interfaces.
PG  - 31954-31975
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.5c03506 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we numerically investigate the levitation behaviors of a drop 
      impacting an immiscible liquid-liquid interface, disregarding the influence of 
      gravitational acceleration. Through energy budget analysis, we elucidate that the 
      phenomenological model proposed by Sanjay et al. (J. Fluid Mech., 2023, vol. 958, 
      p A25) and Jha et al. (Soft Matter. 2020, vol. 16, pp 7270-7273) is partially 
      applicable to drop impact on liquid-liquid interfaces. Specifically, the 
      magnitude of energy transferred from the impacting drop to the liquid film 
      remains unchanged despite a two-orders-of-magnitude variation in the density of 
      the surrounding liquid. Additionally, the normalized maximum film deflection 
      exhibits a significant two-stage growth characteristic with increasing liquid 
      film thickness under conditions of relatively high liquid film viscosity or an 
      interfacial tension coefficient ratio. When the liquid film thickness is 
      relatively low, the energy transfer from the impacting drop to the liquid film is 
      also insensitive to changes in the interfacial tension coefficient ratio.

AB  - The general prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains 
      extremely dismal, due to the high frequency of metastasis. Since 2003, our 
      research group has explored the gene expression profiles of metastasized HCC 
      tissue samples and identified a significant upregulation of CCN3. However, the 
      role and precise pathological function of CCN3 remains elusive. We showed that 
      CCN3 is associated with the poor prognosis of patients with HCC, the malignant 
      phenotype of HCC, and vascular thrombosis. We further evaluated the negative 
      roles of CCN3 in vitro and in vivo, and identified osteopontin (OPN), and 
      coagulation factors tissue factor (TF) and thrombin as the leading genes 
      downstream of CCN3, that are positively associated with HCC cell stemness. We 
      demonstrated that overexpressed CCN3 in HCC cells leads to enhanced survival and 
      increased number of pulmonary metastases in vivo. The elevated levels of OPN and 
      TF were associated with signal activation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and 
      extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). Our findings suggest CCN3 is a 
      potential therapeutic target that would affect the upregulation of OPN and 
      coagulation factors, which would lead to an enhanced stemness and blood 
      coagulation microenvironment in HCC tissue.

AB  - Granular β-1,3-glucan extracted from the wall of Ganoderma lucidum spores, named 
      GPG, is a bioregulator. In this study, we investigated the structural, thermal, 
      and other physical properties of GPG. We determined whether GPG ameliorated 
      immunosuppression caused by Gemcitabine (GEM) chemotherapy. Triple-negative 
      breast cancer mice with GPG combined with GEM treatment had reduced tumor 
      burdens. In addition, GEM treatment alone altered the tumor 
      microenvironment(TME), including a reduction in antitumor T cells and a rise in 
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, 
      combined GPG treatment reversed the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment 
      induced by GEM. GPG inhibited bone marrow (BM)-derived MDSC differentiation and 
      reversed MDSC expansion induced by conditioned medium (CM) in GEM-treated E0771 
      cells through a Dectin-1 pathway. In addition, GPG downgraded PD-L1 and IDO1 
      expression on MDSC while boosting MHC-II, CD86, TNF-α, and IL-6 expression. In 
      conclusion, this study demonstrated that GPG could alleviate the adverse effects 
      induced by GEM chemotherapy by regulating TME.

      of the fibroblast infiltration into the tumor microenvironment.
PG  - 21216-21231
LID - 10.18632/aging.203424 [doi]
AB  - The dismal outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is attributable to 
      high frequency of metastasis and. Identification of effective biomarkers is a key 
      strategy to inform prognosis and improve survival. Previous studies reported 
      inconsistent roles of WISP2 in carcinogenesis, while the role of WISP2 in HCC 
      progression also remains unclear. In this study, we confirmed that WISP2 was 
      downregulated in HCC tissues, and WISP2 was acting as a protective factor, 
      especially in patients without alcohol intake using multiple online datasets. In 
      addition, we reported that upregulation of WISP2 in HCC was related to inhibition 
      of the malignant phenotype in vitro, but these alterations were not observed in 
      vivo. WISP2 also negatively correlated with tumour purity, and increased 
      infiltration of fibroblasts promoted malignant progression in HCC tissues. The 
      enhanced infiltration ability of fibroblasts was related to upregulated HMGB1 
      after overexpression of WISP2 in HCC. The findings shed light on the anticancer 
      role of WISP2, and HMGB1 is one of the key factors involved in the inhibition of 
      the efficiency of WISP2 through reducing the tumour purity with fibroblast 
      infiltration.

TI  - Decreased Expression of TMEM173 Predicts Poor Prognosis in Patients with 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal cancer types, and 
      chronic infection with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is identified as the strongest 
      risk factor for HCC. Transmembrane Protein 173 (TMEM173) is a pattern recognition 
      receptor which functions as a major regulator of the innate immune response to 
      viral and bacterial infections. However, the prognostic value of TMEM173 in HCC 
      remains elusive. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the potential prognostic significance 
      of TMEM173 expression in HCC patients following curative resection. 
      Immunohistochemistry was used to detect TMEM173 expression in 96 HCC patients. We 
      found that TMEM173 protein expression was remarkably decreased in tumor tissues 
      compared to non-tumor tissues, and that TMEM173 staining intensity was inversely 
      correlated with tumor size, tumor invasion TNM stage and overall survival (OS) in 
      HCC patients. Multivariate analysis supported TMEM173 as an independent 
      prognostic factor, and identified that combining TMEM173 expression with TNM 
      stage showed better prognostic efficiency for OS in HCC patients. In summary, 
      TMEM173 was discovered having an independent prognostic value and may serve as a 
      potential immunotherapeutic target for HCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health concern, 
      necessitating a deeper understanding of its prognosis and underlying mechanisms. 
      This study aimed to investigate the mechanism and prognostic value of CD8(+) T 
      Cell exhaustion (CD8(+) TEX)-related genes in HCC and construct a survival 
      prognosis prediction model for patients with HCC. METHODS: CD8(+) TEX-related 
      genes associated with HCC prognosis were analysed and identified, and a 
      prognostic prediction model was constructed using the 'least absolute shrinkage 
      and selection operator' Cox regression model. Immunohistochemistry was used to 
      verify the expression of the model genes in HCC tissues. A nomogram was 
      constructed based on risk scores and clinical features, and its predictive 
      efficacy was verified. The expression of STAM, ANXA5, and MAD2L2 in HCC cell 
      lines was detected by western blotting; subsequently, these genes were knocked 
      down in HCC cell lines by small interfering RNA, and their effects on the 
      proliferation and migration of HCC cell lines were detected by colony formation 
      assay, cck8, wound healing, and transwell assays. RESULTS: Six genes related to 
      CD8(+) TEX were included in the risk-prediction model. The prognosis of patients 
      with HCC in the low-risk group was significantly better than that of those in the 
      high-risk group. Cox regression analysis revealed that the risk score was an 
      independent risk factor for the prognosis of patients with HCC. The 
      differentially expressed genes in patients with high-risk HCC were mainly 
      enriched in the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein-like 
      receptor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1, and tumour programmed cell death protein 
      (PD)-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathways. The CD8(+) TEX-related genes STAM, 
      ANXA5, and MAD2L2 were knocked down in HCC cell lines to significantly inhibit 
      cell proliferation and migration. The prediction results of the nomogram based on 
      the risk score showed a good fit and application value. CONCLUSION: The 
      prediction model based on CD8(+) TEX-related genes can predict the prognosis of 
      HCC and provide a theoretical basis for the early identification of patients with 
      poor HCC prognosis.

TI  - Development of a machine learning-based model for predicting risk of early 
      postoperative recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 5804-5817
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v29.i43.5804 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical resection is the primary treatment for hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). However, studies indicate that nearly 70% of patients experience 
      HCC recurrence within five years following hepatectomy. The earlier the 
      recurrence, the worse the prognosis. Current studies on postoperative recurrence 
      primarily rely on postoperative pathology and patient clinical data, which are 
      lagging. Hence, developing a new pre-operative prediction model for postoperative 
      recurrence is crucial for guiding individualized treatment of HCC patients and 
      enhancing their prognosis. AIM: To identify key variables in pre-operative 
      clinical and imaging data using machine learning algorithms to construct multiple 
      risk prediction models for early postoperative recurrence of HCC. METHODS: The 
      demographic and clinical data of 371 HCC patients were collected for this 
      retrospective study. These data were randomly divided into training and test sets 
      at a ratio of 8:2. The training set was analyzed, and key feature variables with 
      predictive value for early HCC recurrence were selected to construct six 
      different machine learning prediction models. Each model was evaluated, and the 
      best-performing model was selected for interpreting the importance of each 
      variable. Finally, an online calculator based on the model was generated for 
      daily clinical practice. RESULTS: Following machine learning analysis, eight key 
      feature variables (age, intratumoral arteries, alpha-fetoprotein, pre-operative 
      blood glucose, number of tumors, glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio, liver cirrhosis, 
      and pre-operative platelets) were selected to construct six different prediction 
      models. The XGBoost model outperformed other models, with the area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve in the training, validation, and test 
      datasets being 0.993 (95% confidence interval: 0.982-1.000), 0.734 (0.601-0.867), 
      and 0.706 (0.585-0.827), respectively. Calibration curve and decision curve 
      analysis indicated that the XGBoost model also had good predictive performance 
      and clinical application value. CONCLUSION: The XGBoost model exhibits superior 
      performance and is a reliable tool for predicting early postoperative HCC 
      recurrence. This model may guide surgical strategies and postoperative 
      individualized medicine.

TI  - Optimal Timing of Cholecystectomy for Patients with Concurrent Acute 
      Cholecystitis and Acute Cholangitis after Successful Biliary Drainage by 
      Interventional Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography.
LID - 10.3390/jcm11216603 [doi]
LID - 6603
AB  - Background: Concurrent acute cholecystitis and acute cholangitis is a unique 
      clinical situation. We tried to investigate the optimal timing of cholecystectomy 
      after adequate biliary drainage under this condition. Methods: From January 2012 
      to November 2017, we retrospectively screened all in-hospitalized patients 
      undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and then 
      identified patients with concurrent acute cholecystitis and acute cholangitis 
      from the cohort. The selected patients were stratified into two groups: one-stage 
      intervention (OSI) group (intended laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the same 
      hospitalization) vs. two-stage intervention (TSI) group (interval intended 
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Interrogated outcomes included recurrent biliary 
      events, length of hospitalization, and surgical outcomes. Results: There were 147 
      patients ultimately enrolled for analysis (OSI vs. TSI, 96 vs. 51). Regarding 
      surgical outcomes, there was no significant difference between the OSI group and 
      TSI group, including intraoperative blood transfusion (1.0% vs. 2.0%, p = 1.000), 
      conversion to open procedure (3.1% vs. 7.8%, p = 0.236), postoperative 
      complication (6.3% vs. 11.8%, p = 0.342), operation time (118.0 min vs. 125.8 
      min, p = 0.869), and postoperative days until discharge (3.37 days vs. 4.02 days, 
      p = 0.643). In the RBE analysis, the OSI group presented a significantly lower 
      incidence of overall RBE (5.2% vs. 41.2%, p < 0.001) than the TSI group. 
      Conclusions: Patients with an initial diagnosis of concurrent acute cholecystitis 
      and cholangitis undergoing cholecystectomy after ERCP drainage during the same 
      hospitalization period may receive some benefit in terms of clinical outcomes.

TI  - An Investigation of the Prescription Patterns of Chinese Herbal Products for 
      Chronic Glomerulonephritis Patients: A Hospital-Based Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 5080764

LID - 5080764
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a high incidence and prevalence worldwide, and 
      chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) is one of the main causes of CKD. Therefore, it 
      is important to diagnose and treat CGN early. The purpose of this study is to 
      analyze the prescription patterns and frequencies of Chinese herbal products 
      (CHPs) for CGN by using a hospital-based database from the Chang Gung Memorial 
      Hospital (CGMH), a large, tertiary hospital system in Taiwan, and to evaluate the 
      safety and possible efficacy of CHPs by blood test. The International 
      Classification of Disease Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 582 was used to identify 
      patients with CGN. From 2004 to 2015, a total of 54726 CHP prescriptions for CGN 
      were provided. Association rule mining was used to analyze the prevalent of CHP 
      combination patterns in treating CGN. Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San (JWXYS) and Gorgon 
      (Euryale feroxSalisb.) were the most frequently prescribed herbal formula (HF) 
      and single herb (SH), respectively. The most frequently prescribed combination of 
      CHPs was that of JWXYS with Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu-Tang (BYHWT) in CGMH. In statistical, 
      the level of eGFR in Stage 3a and 3b group was increasing after treatment in 6 
      and 12 months and might not cause the renal function to worsen within 12-month 
      treatments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
      pharmacoepidemiological study to review CHP treatments for CGN. However,

AB  - PURPOSE: Retinal degenerative diseases (RDDs) cause irreversible vision loss with 
      limited treatment options. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas have 
      demonstrated neuroprotective effects, yet their overall efficacy lacks 
      comprehensive meta-evidence. The aim of this study was to exploratively evaluate 
      the neuroprotective effects of TCM formulas in animal RDD models. METHODS: A 
      comprehensive literature search was conducted across eight electronic databases 
      to identify animal studies that evaluated the neuroprotective effects of TCM 
      formulas on RDDs. Pairwise meta-analysis and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) 
      were performed to synthesize evidence on key outcomes: neural growth, glial 
      activation, oxidative stress, apoptosis factors, and ophthalmological parameters. 
      Treatment rankings were assessed using the surface under the cumulative ranking 
      curve (SUCRA). RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included. The compositions and 
      bioactive compounds of the TCM formulas have been defined and identified. 
      Pairwise meta-analysis demonstrated that specific TCM formulas might exert 
      neuroprotective effects on RDDs by regulating key biomarkers. Specifically, 
      Zhen-Bao-Wan, Bu-Shen-Yi-Jing-Fang, and Qi-Shen-Yi-Qi pills modulated neural 
      growth and glial activation by upregulating BDNF, CNTF, and reducing GFAP, 
      respectively. Furthermore, Yi-Qi-Wen-Yang-Tong-Luo decoction, Zi-Yin-Ming-Mu 
      decoction, and Yishi-Tablet suppressed oxidative stress and apoptosis by reducing 
      SOD, retinal apoptotic cells and caspase-3, respectively. Additionally, 
      Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu decoction improved retinal function by elevating ERG-a and ERG-b 
      wave amplitudes. Subgroup analyses indicated that Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu decoction and 
      Qu-Yu-Tong-Luo prescription exhibited superior efficacy in restoring retinal 
      ganglion cell (RGC) counts and retinal thickness in specific RDD models. The NMA 
      results indicated that the included TCM formulas exhibited target-specific and 
      dose‒response trends, with different formulas showing preferential efficacy for 
      distinct biomarkers. Given the limitations identified in this study, these 
      findings should be interpreted as preliminary evidence to guide future research 
      rather than as conclusive results. Future studies with rigorous experimental 
      designs are needed to address these limitations and enhance translational 
      relevance. CONCLUSION: This study provides preclinical and exploratory evidence 
      that the included TCM formulas might exert neuroprotective effects on animal 
      models of RDDs by modulating glial activation, promoting neuronal growth, and 
      inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis. Additional high-quality preclinical 
      studies are essential to validate these effects and inform future clinical 
      translation. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION:

TI  - Clinical Evaluation of a Blood Assay to Diagnose Paucibacillary Tuberculosis via 
      Bacterial Antigens.
PG  - 791-800
LID - 10.1373/clinchem.2017.273698 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) cases primarily relies on 
      methods that detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacilli or their DNA in 
      patient samples (e.g., mycobacterial culture and Xpert MTB/RIF assays), but these 
      tests have low clinical sensitivity for patients with paucibacillary TB disease. 
      Our goal was to evaluate the clinical performance of a newly developed assay that 
      can rapidly diagnose active TB cases by direct detection of Mtb-derived antigens 
      in patients' blood samples. METHODS: Nanoparticle (NanoDisk)-enriched peptides 
      derived from the Mtb virulence factors CFP-10 (10-kDa culture factor protein) and 
      ESAT-6 (6-kDa early secretory antigenic target) were analyzed by high-throughput 
      mass spectrometry (MS). Serum from 294 prospectively enrolled Chinese adults were 
      analyzed with this NanoDisk-MS method to evaluate the performance of direct serum 
      Mtb antigen measurement as a means for rapid diagnosis of active TB cases. 
      RESULTS: NanoDisk-MS diagnosed 174 (88.3%) of the study's TB cases, with 95.8% 
      clinical specificity, and with 91.6% and 85.3% clinical sensitivity for 
      culture-positive and culture-negative TB cases, respectively. NanoDisk-MS also 
      exhibited 88% clinical sensitivity for pulmonary and 90% for extrapulmonary TB, 
      exceeding the diagnostic performance of mycobacterial culture for these cases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Direct detection and quantification of serum Mtb antigens by 
      NanoDisk-MS can rapidly and accurately diagnose active TB in adults, independent 
      of disease site or culture status, and outperform Mycobacterium-based TB 
      diagnostics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Chinese medicine formulation ISF-1 (also known as 
      Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu-Tang) for post-stroke rehabilitation could increase the 
      expression of growth-regulating protein follistatin by approximately 4-fold. This 
      study aims to identify the active compounds of ISF-1 for the induction of 
      follistatin expression. METHODS: Active compounds in ISF-1 responsible for 
      induction of follistatin were identified by a bioactivity-guided fractionation 
      procedure involving liquid-liquid extraction, HPLC separation and RT-PCR 
      detection. The aqueous extracts of seven ISF-1 ingredients including Semen 
      Persicae (Tao Ren) and the S. Persicae-derived fractions were assayed for the 
      induction of follistatin mRNA expression in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells by 
      RT-PCR. The concentrations of isolated compounds were proportionally normalized 
      to the reported IC50 concentration (5.8 mg/mL) of the formulation ISF-1 in HepG2. 
      The active fractions were characterized by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 column and 
      identified by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Three ingredients of ISF-1, namely S. 
      Persicae (Tao Ren), Pheretima (Di Long), and Flos Carthami (Hong Hua), induced 
      the expression of follistatin mRNA. Among these, the ingredient S. Persicae were 
      the most active, and amygdalin from S. Persicae extract was identified as a novel 
      follistatin inducer. Amygdalin stimulated the growth of skeletal muscle cell line 
      C2C12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Amygdalin isolated 
      from S. Persicae extract in ISF-1 through a bioactivity-guided fractionation 
      procedure induced the expression of follistatin in HepG2 and C2C12 cell lines.

TI  - Noncontrast-enhanced MRI-based Noninvasive Score for Portal Hypertension 
      (CHESS1802): An International Multicenter Study.
PG  - 818-827
LID - 10.14218/JCTH.2021.00177 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study aimed to determine the performance of the 
      non-invasive score using noncontrast-enhanced MRI (CHESS-DIS score) for detecting 
      portal hypertension in cirrhosis. METHODS: In this international multicenter, 
      diagnostic study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03766880), patients with cirrhosis who 
      had hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement and noncontrast-enhanced 
      MRI were prospectively recruited from four university hospitals in China (n=4) 
      and Turkey (n=1) between December 2018 and April 2019. A cohort of patients was 
      retrospectively recruited from a university hospital in Italy between March 2015 
      and November 2017. After segmentation of the liver on fat-suppressed T1-weighted 
      MRI maps, CHESS-DIS score was calculated automatically by an in-house developed 
      code based on the quantification of liver surface nodularity. RESULTS: A total of 
      149 patients were included, of which 124 were from four Chinese hospitals 
      (training cohort) and 25 were from two international hospitals (validation 
      cohort). A positive correlation between CHESS-DIS score and HVPG was found with 
      the correlation coefficients of 0.36 (p<0.0001) and 0.55 (p<0.01) for the 
      training and validation cohorts, respectively. The area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve of CHESS-DIS score in detection of clinically 
      significant portal hypertension (CSPH) was 0.81 and 0.9 in the training and 
      validation cohorts, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficients for 
      assessing the inter- and intra-observer agreement were 0.846 and 0.841, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A non-invasive score using noncontrast-enhanced MRI 
      was developed and proved to be significantly correlated with invasive HVPG. 
      Besides, this score could be used to detect CSPH in patients with cirrhosis.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignancy with dysregulated differentiation. 
      However, effective differentiation therapy for HCC is lacking. Previous evidence 
      suggests that CXCR7 is associated with the differentiation of embryonic stem 
      cells. Here, we evaluated the potential role of CXCR7 in the differentiation of 
      HCC. In HCC cell lines, the expression of cancer stem cell-related markers was 
      assessed by flow cytometry and confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence 
      analyses. Dimethyl sulfoxide, oncostatin M and dexamethasone were used to induce 
      the differentiation of HCC. Immunohistochemical assay was performed on a tissue 
      microarray based on 112 HCC cases that received hepatectomy. Ligand activation, 
      inhibition assays and RNA interference were used to analyze the regulation of 
      hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) by the CXCR7 pathway. Huh7 and HCCLM3 cell 
      lines were screened for differentiation induction based on biomarkers of hepatic 
      cancer stem cells. CXCR7 was found to be closely associated with the 
      differentiation of HCC, and an inverse expression trend between CXCR7 and HNF4α 
      was found upon induced differentiation. Clinically, high CXCR7 expression was 
      negatively correlated with HNF4α expression in patients with relatively 
      well-differentiated HCC. Moreover, high CXCR7 expression was correlated with poor 
      overall survival and accelerated post-resection metastasis in HCC with a low 
      HNF4α level. Mechanistically, CXCR7 signaling inhibited HNF4α through 
      extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) activation, which was inhibited by 
      U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK/ERK kinases 1 and 2. Knockdown of CXCR7 further 
      confirmed that CXCR7 signaling can regulate HNF4α expression. Taken together, our 
      findings indicate that CXCR7 participates in the differentiation of HCC by 
      regulating HNF4α. The CXCR7-ERK-HNF4α cascade represents a new target for the 
      differentiation therapy of HCC.

TI  - Comparison of outcomes of proximal versus distal and combined splenic artery 
      embolization in the management of blunt splenic injury: a report of 202 cases 
      from a single trauma center.
PG  - 4689-4697
LID - 10.1007/s00464-023-09960-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare the outcomes of blunt splenic injuries (BSI) managed with 
      proximal (P) versus distal (D) versus combined (C) splenic artery embolization 
      (SAE). METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with BSI who 
      demonstrated vascular injuries on angiograms and were managed with SAE between 
      2001 and 2015. The success rate and major complications (Clavien-Dindo 
      classification ≥ III) were compared between the P, D, and C embolizations. 
      RESULTS: In total, 202 patients were enrolled (P, n = 64, 31.7%; D, n = 84, 
      41.6%; C, n = 54, 26.7%). The median injury severity score was 25. The median 
      times from injury to SAE were 8.3, 7.0, and 6.6 h for the P, D, and C 
      embolization, respectively. The overall haemostasis success rates were 92.6%, 
      93.8%, 88.1%, and 98.1% in the P, D, and C embolizations, respectively, with no 
      significant difference (p = 0.079). Additionally, the outcomes were not 
      significantly different between the different types of vascular injuries on 
      angiograms or the materials used in the location of embolization. Splenic abscess 
      occurred in six patients (P, n = 0; D, n = 5; C, n = 1), although it occurred 
      more commonly in those who underwent D embolization with no significant 
      difference (p = 0.092). CONCLUSIONS: The success rate and major complications of 
      SAE were not significantly different regardless of the location of embolization. 
      The different types of vascular injuries on angiograms and agents used in 
      different embolization locations also did not affect the outcomes.

TI  - Measurement algorithm for wafer alignment based on principal component analysis.
PG  - 5569-5580
LID - 10.1364/AO.425767 [doi]
AB  - We propose a novel measurement algorithm for wafer alignment technology based on 
      principal component analysis (PCA) of a mark image. The waveform of the mark is 
      extracted from the enlarged mark image, which is collected by CCD. The position 
      of the mark center on the CCD can be calculated based on the extracted waveform. 
      By applying PCA to the mark image, the first principal component containing 
      position information of the mark can be obtained. Therefore PCA can be used to 
      extract the waveform from the mark image. Compared with the typical waveform 
      extraction method (the summed projection (SP) method), the proposed PCA method 
      can use the position information contained in the mark image more effectively. 
      Through simulation and experiment, it is proved that the proposed PCA method can 
      improve the contrast of the normalized waveform, and then improve the alignment 
      accuracy.

TI  - OSCAR facilitates malignancy with enhanced metastasis correlating to inhibitory 
      immune microenvironment in multiple cancer types.
PG  - 3769-3780
LID - 10.7150/jca.51964 [doi]
AB  - Cross talk between tumors and the immune microenvironment play a critical role in 
      the malignant progression. The osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR) is a 
      regulator of lymphocyte differentiation and maturation, but little is known about 
      the role of OSCAR in multiple cancer types. We comprehensively analyzed OSCAR 
      expression and explored its correlation with prognosis in multiple cancer types 
      using Oncomine, TIMER, Gene GEPIA2 and CCLE. We examined OSCAR expression 
      correlations with lymph node metastasis and pathological stage across tumor 
      samples using UALCAN and GEPIA2. We analyzed the effects of OSCAR on survival 
      using the Kaplan Meier plotter. We explored genes co-expressed with OSCAR using 
      the LinkedOmics database and analyzed associated gene ontologies using Metascape. 
      Further, we examined the correlation between OSCAR expression and immunocyte 
      infiltration, markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and lymphocyte 
      subtypes using TIMER. OSCAR mRNA levels were upregulated in most cancer types 
      compared with adjacent normal tissues. Higher expression of OSCAR correlated with 
      lymph node metastasis or advanced stage subgroups. High expression of OSCAR was 
      related to low tumor purity, with increased levels of M2 macrophage polarization, 
      T cells exhaustion, and mesenchymal phenotype in most cancer types. We also 
      showed that the strength of OSCAR expression influence in malignant progression 
      and inhibitory immune microenvironment is mitigated by the infiltration of 
      natural killer cells. These findings shed light on the pro-carcinogenic role of 
      OSCAR in most cancer types and indicate OSCAR could be targeted in future 
      therapeutics to reverse the inhibitory immune microenvironment.

AB  - Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by the Fusarium graminearum species complex, 
      poses a significant threat to global wheat production and human health due to its 
      high virulence and the ability to produce harmful secondary metabolites. Although 
      various fungicides have been extensively used to control FHB, there is a critical 
      need for more comprehensive information on the resistance of F. graminearum to 
      fluopyram in China. This study evaluated the sensitivity of F. graminearum 
      strains collected from five distinct regions to fluopyram. The EC(50) values for 
      fluopyram ranged from 1.20 to 6.42 μg/mL, with an average value of 3.30 μg/mL. 
      Additionally, fluopyram-resistant mutants were generated in the laboratory by 
      chemical taming, with a resistance frequency of 8.3 × 10-(-3). Furthermore, no 
      significant differences were observed in conidiation, growth rate, and 
      temperature sensitivity between the resistant mutants and the parental strains. 
      It was also determined that fluopyram exhibits positive cross-resistance with 
      pydiflumetofen but no cross-resistance with carbendazim, tebuconazole, and 
      pyraclostrobin. The mutations associated with fluopyram resistance in F. 
      graminearum were identified as SDHB-H248L, SDHC2-A83V, and SDHC2-R86K. Based on 
      these findings, the risk of resistance development in F. graminearum to fluopyram 
      was assessed as moderate. Additionally, it was found that the combination of 
      prothioconazole and fluopyram is more effective than their individual use in 
      field trials. Considering the role of fluopyram in inhibiting DON produced by F. 
      graminearum, it is recommended that fluopyram be used in conjunction with other 
      highly effective fungicides to control FHB, thereby achieving both disease 
      control and mycotoxin reduction.

AB  - Central vein perforation associated with a mediastinal lesion is a rare 
      complication of catheterization. A 50-year-old woman was diagnosed with chronic 
      kidney disease and required hemodialysis treatment. The patient developed central 
      vein injury during attempted placement of a double-channel catheter. A computed 
      tomographic scan and venography showed that the catheter had punctured the 
      mediastinum from the central vein. After comprehensive assessment and 
      multidisciplinary consultation, percutaneous catheter thrombin injection with 
      follow-up balloon dilatation under fluoroscopy guidance successfully fixed the 
      perforation. We summarize the therapeutic strategy of this complication and other 
      treatment options, and discuss the related literature of central vein injury.

TI  - Oxaliplatin resistance is enhanced by saracatinib via upregulation Wnt-ABCG1 
      signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemo-resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major 
      problem, and acquired drug resistance prevents cancer therapies from achieving 
      complete responses. Molecular targeting therapy presents an opportunity to impede 
      tumor through combination or sequential therapy, while the accurate effect is 
      vague. METHODS: The efficacy of combinations between oxaliplatin and anti-cancer 
      molecular targeting drugs was screened. Strangely, the combined chemotherapy with 
      oxaliplatin and saracatinib induced significantly antagonistic effects. Then the 
      antitumor effects of combined treatment with saracatinib and oxaliplatin were 
      confirmed in wide type HCC as well as in saracatinib- and oxaliplatin-resistant 
      HCC. RNA sequencing was used to explore the resistance mechanism, and the roles 
      of ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) and Wnt signaling in oxaliplatin 
      resistance were confirmed. RESULTS: Chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and saracatinib 
      individually induced strong anti-HCC effects, while combined or sequential 
      treatment of HCC cells with these two drugs exhibited reduced efficacy compared 
      to treatment with the single drugs. And it was saracatinib treatment caused 
      oxaliplatin resistance. RNA sequencing revealed 458 genes that were altered by 
      treatment with saracatinib and oxaliplatin. Of these, the gene encoding ABCG1 and 
      Wnt-associated genes were significantly upregulated. Upregulation of ABCG1 and 
      oxaliplatin resistance were associated with activation of Wnt signaling. 
      Interference with ABCG1 expression or inhibition of Wnt signaling resulted in 
      reversal of the saracatinib-induced oxaliplatin resistance in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These studies demonstrated that combined or sequential chemotherapy with 
      oxaliplatin and saracatinib reduced antitumor efficacy, and this antagonism was 
      attributed to the activation of Wnt signaling and upregulation of ABCG1 by 
      saracatinib.

AB  - Sorafenib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a standard treatment for 
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study was undertaken to 
      determine whether the growth and metastasis of HCC were influenced in mice 
      receiving sorafenib prior to implantation with tumors, and to investigate the 
      in-vivo and in-vitro effect of sorafenib on natural killer (NK) cells. In 
      sorafenib-pretreated BALB/c nu/nu mice and C57BL/6 mice, tumor growth was 
      accelerated, mouse survival was decreased, and lung metastasis was increased. 
      However, the depletion of NK1.1(+) cells in C57BL/6 mice eliminated 
      sorafenib-mediated pro-metastatic effects. Sorafenib significantly reduced the 
      number of NK cells and inhibited reactivity of NK cells against tumor cells, in 
      both tumor-bearing and tumor-free C57BL/6 mice. Sorafenib down-regulated the 
      stimulatory receptor CD69 in NK cells of tumor-bearing mice, but not in 
      tumor-free mice, and inhibited proliferation of NK92-MI cells, which is 
      associated with the blocking of the PI3K/AKT pathway, and inhibited cytotoxicity 
      of NK cells in response to tumor targets, which was due to impaired ERK 
      phosphorylation. These results suggest immunotherapeutic approaches activating NK 
      cells may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib in HCC patients.

TI  - Noise Reduction Method for Quantifying Nanoparticle Light Scattering in Low 
      Magnification Dark-Field Microscope Far-Field Images.
PG  - 12001-12005
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03661 [doi]
AB  - Nanoparticles have become a powerful tool for cell imaging and biomolecule, cell 
      and protein interaction studies, but are difficult to rapidly and accurately 
      measure in most assays. Dark-field microscope (DFM) image analysis approaches 
      used to quantify nanoparticles require high-magnification near-field (HN) images 
      that are labor intensive due to a requirement for manual image selection and 
      focal adjustments needed when identifying and capturing new regions of interest. 
      Low-magnification far-field (LF) DFM imagery is technically simpler to perform 
      but cannot be used as an alternate to HN-DFM quantification, since it is highly 
      sensitive to surface artifacts and debris that can easily mask nanoparticle 
      signal. We now describe a new noise reduction approach that markedly reduces 
      LF-DFM image artifacts to allow sensitive and accurate nanoparticle signal 
      quantification from LF-DFM images. We have used this approach to develop a "Dark 
      Scatter Master" (DSM) algorithm for the popular NIH image analysis program 
      ImageJ, which can be readily adapted for use with automated high-throughput assay 
      analyses. This method demonstrated robust performance quantifying nanoparticles 
      in different assay formats, including a novel method that quantified 
      extracellular vesicles in patient blood sample to detect pancreatic cancer cases. 
      Based on these results, we believe our LF-DFM quantification method can markedly 
      decrease the analysis time of most nanoparticle-based assays to impact both basic 
      research and clinical analyses.

AB  - We investigated the effect of Chinese herbal compound Song-you Yin on HCC 
      stemness. MHCC97H and Hep3B cell lines were pretreated with SYY for 4 weeks, and 
      their chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin was evaluated. The expression of 
      CSC-related markers, cell invasion and migration, and colony formation were also 
      examined. SYY-treated orthotopic nude mouse models of human HCC were developed to 
      explore the effect of oxaliplatin on tumor growth, metastasis, and survival. The 
      CSC-related molecular changes in vivo were also evaluated. The result showed that 
      MHCC97H and Hep3B cells pretreated with SYY showed significantly increased 
      chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin and the downregulation of CSC-related markers 
      CD90, CD24, and EPCAM. SYY also attenuated cell motility, invasion, and colony 
      formation in MHCC97H and Hep3B cell lines. The reduced tumorigenicity and 
      pulmonary metastasis were observed in SYY-pretreated cell lines. Combination 
      treatment with oxaliplatin and SYY significantly reduced tumor volume and 
      pulmonary metastasis and prolonged survival compared with oxaliplatin treatment 
      alone. Immunohistochemical analysis showed reduced expression of CD90, ABCG2, 
      ALDH, CD44, EPCAM, vimentin, and MMP-9 and increased the expression of 
      E-cadherin, in HCC cells following combination treatment. These data clearly 
      demonstrate that SYY renders hepatocellular carcinoma sensitive to oxaliplatin 
      through the inhibition of stemness.

TI  - Calibration method of overlay measurement error caused by asymmetric mark.
PG  - 9814-9821
LID - 10.1364/AO.57.009814 [doi]
AB  - With the process nodes extending to sub-10-nm in advanced semiconductor 
      manufacturing, the overlay requirements keep progressively scaling down, which 
      makes it very important to measure overlay precisely for monitoring on-product 
      performance. The overlay mark being asymmetrical when generated via the 
      lithography process, this asymmetry will be slightly variated even in the same 
      process or same lot, and it will bring overlay measurement error. In general, the 
      wafer alignment data are used for correcting this overlay measurement error, 
      utilizing its wavelengths and polarizations dependence. However, there is a 
      residual error that cannot be removed because the structures of the wafer 
      alignment mark and overlay mark are different and are affected by the process 
      differently. In this paper, a new method is proposed for calibrating the overlay 
      measurement error introduced by the asymmetric mark, which is based on the 
      relationship between measurement data of the overlay mark and the single layer 
      mark. The validity is verified by simulation with different types of asymmetric 
      mark. It is very useful for improving overlay measurement accuracy and for 
      understanding how the overlay measurement error is affected by the asymmetric 
      mark.

TI  - CCN2-MAPK-Id-1 loop feedback amplification is involved in maintaining stemness in 
      oxaliplatin-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 440-453
LID - 10.1007/s12072-019-09960-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer 
      death worldwide. Chemotherapy is an alternative treatment for advanced HCCs, but 
      chemo-resistance prevents cancer therapies from achieving stable and complete 
      responses. Understanding the underlying mechanisms in chemo-resistance is 
      critical to improve the efficacy of HCC. METHODS: The expression levels of Id-1 
      and CCN2 were detected in large cohorts of HCCs, and functional analyses of Id-1 
      and CCN2 were performed both in vitro and in vivo. cDNA microarrays were 
      performed to evaluate the alterations of expression profiling of HCC cells with 
      overexpression of CCN2. Finally, the role of downstream signaling of MAPK/Id-1 
      signaling pathway in oxaliplatin resistance were also explored. RESULTS: The 
      increased expression of Id-1 and CCN2 were closely related to oxaliplatin 
      resistance in HCC. Upregulation of CCN2 and Id-1 was independently associated 
      with shorter survival and increased recurrence in HCC patients, and significantly 
      enhanced oxaliplatin resistance and promoted lung metastasis in vivo, whereas 
      knock-down of their expression significantly reversed the chemo-resistance and 
      inhibited HCC cell stemness. cDNA microarrays and PCR revealed that Id-1 and MAPK 
      pathway were the downstream signaling of CCN2. CCN2 significantly enhanced 
      oxaliplatin resistance by activating the MAPK/Id-1 signaling pathway, and Id-1 
      could upregulate CCN2 in a positive feedback manner. CONCLUSIONS: CCN2/MAPK/Id-1 
      loop feedback amplification is involved in oxaliplatin resistance, and the 
      combination of oxaliplatin with inhibitor of CCN2 or MAPK signaling could provide 
      a promising approach to ameliorating oxaliplatin resistance in HCC.

TI  - Depletion of MRPL35 inhibits gastric carcinoma cell proliferation by regulating 
      downstream signaling proteins.
PG  - 1785-1804
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v27.i16.1785 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastric carcinoma (GC) is a digestive system disease with high 
      morbidity and mortality. However, early clinical detection is difficult, and the 
      therapeutic effect for advanced disease is not satisfactory. Thus, finding new 
      tumor markers and therapeutic targets conducive to the treatment of GC is 
      imperative. MRPL35 is a member of the large subunit family of mitochondrial 
      ribosomal protein. MRPL35 shows the characteristic of oncogene in colorectal 
      cancer and esophageal cancer, which promotes the exploration of the correlation 
      between MRPL35 and GC. We proposed that the expression of MRPL35 might be 
      critical in GC. AIM: To study the effect of MRPL35 knockdown on GC cell 
      proliferation. METHODS: The expression of MRPL35 in GC was evaluated based on 
      data from the public tumor database UALCAN (www.ualcan.path.uab.edu). The effect 
      of the expression of MRPL35 on the prognosis was evaluated with KMplot 
      (www.kmplot.com). The expression of MRPL35 was assessed on the tissue microarray 
      by immunohistochemistry and the level of MRPL35 mRNA in 25 pairs of clinical GC 
      tissues and matched adjacent tissues was detected by quantitative reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Celigo cell count assay, colony 
      formation assay, and flow cytometry were used to assess the role of MRPL35 in GC 
      cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro. Additionally, tumor formation 
      experiment in BALB/c nude mice was utilized to determine the effect of MRPL35 on 
      GC cell proliferation. After knockdown of MRPL35, related proteins were 
      identified by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification analysis, 
      and the expression of related proteins was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: The 
      expression of MRPL35 was up-regulated in GC (P = 1.77 × 10(-4)). The Kaplan-Meier 
      plots of the overall survival indicated that high expression of MRPL35 was 
      associated with a poor survival in GC. Compared with adjacent tissues, the 
      expression of MRPL35 in GC tissues was increased, which was related to age (P = 
      0.03), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.007), and pathological tumor-node-metastasis 
      stage (P = 0.024). Knockdown of MRPL35 inhibited GC cell proliferation and colony 
      formation and induced apoptosis. Animal experiment results showed that knockdown 
      of MRPL35 inhibited tumor formation in BALB/c nude mice. Western blotting 
      analysis showed that after knockdown of MRPL35, the expression of PICK1 and 
      BCL-XL proteins decreased, and that of AGR2 protein increased. CONCLUSION: 
      Collectively, our findings demonstrate that knockdown of MRPL35 inhibits GC cell 
      proliferation through related proteins including PICK1, BCL-XL, and AGR2.

TI  - Multiscale microfluidic platform with vacuum-driven chambers for automated 
      high-volume ssDNA generation.
PG  - 6662-6672
LID - 10.1039/d5lc00785b [doi]
AB  - We present a multiscale microfluidic platform for automated high-volume 
      single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) generation through plasmonic bead-based PCR. Central 
      to the system are vacuum-driven chambers capable of handling fluid volumes in the 
      tens of microliters-at least an order of magnitude larger than conventional 
      microfluidic chambers. These chambers are seamlessly integrated with microfluidic 
      components such as micromixers and pneumatically actuated microvalves, enabling 
      precise fluidic transport in processing high volumes. This architecture overcomes 
      limitations of pressure-driven flow in exchanging fluids in deep geometries. 
      Direct vacuum access to these chambers improves fluid handling efficiency while 
      reducing hardware complexity. We demonstrate the platform's capabilities through 
      automated ssDNA preparation where plasmonic thermocycling is achieved via 
      volumetric heating using gold nanorods dispersed in the reaction mixture. 
      Magnetic beads functionalized with reverse primers facilitate selective 
      amplification and effective strand separation. Despite the large reaction volume 
      (20 μL), 20 PCR cycles are completed within 12 minutes. Fluorescence-based assays 
      confirm 66% recovery of ssDNA from the beads, with 92% retention of complementary 
      strands, indicating minimal contamination by double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). This 
      multiscale integration of vacuum-driven chambers with microfluidic control offers 
      a scalable and automated platform for preparative applications where high-volume 
      processing is essential.

AB  - Optical coherent tomography (OCT) has enabled clinical applications ranging from 
      ophthalmology to cardiology that revolutionized in vivo medical diagnostics in 
      the last few decades, and a variety of endoscopic probes have been developed in 
      order to meet the needs of various endoscopic OCT imaging. We propose a passive 
      driven intravascular optical coherent tomography (IV-OCT) probe in this paper. 
      Instead of using any electrically driven scanning device, the probe makes use of 
      the kinetic energy of the fluid that flushes away the blood during the 
      intravascular optical coherence tomography imaging. The probe converts it into 
      the rotational kinetic energy of the propeller, and the rotation of the 
      rectangular prism mounted on the propeller shaft enables the scanning of the 
      beam. The probe is low cost, and enables unobstructed stable circumferential 
      scanning over 360 deg. The experimental results show that the probe scanning 
      speed can exceed 100 rotations per second (rps). Spectral-domain OCT imaging of a 
      phantom and porcine cardiac artery are demonstrated with axial resolution of 
      13.6 μm, lateral resolution of 22 μm, and sensitivity of 101.7 dB. We present 
      technically the passively driven IV-OCT probe in full detail and discuss how to 
      optimize the probe in further.

TI  - Micromirror array allocation algorithm based on deconvolution.
PG  - 3582-3588
LID - 10.1364/AO.389891 [doi]
AB  - Freeform illumination is one of the necessary techniques in 28 nm technology 
      nodes and beyond. The micromirror array (MMA) has been widely used in lithography 
      freeform illumination systems due to its programmability and high free degree. 
      The MMA allocation algorithm is the key to generate the target freeform 
      illumination source. Its computational speed and precision affect the generation 
      speed and precision of the target illumination source as well as the process 
      window size of the generated illumination pupil directly. In this paper, an MMA 
      allocation method based on deconvolution is proposed. The target freeform 
      illumination source can be obtained directly with the deconvolution and 
      quantization processes. Without the iterative optimization process, the 
      computational speed of the proposed method is much faster than that of the 
      traditional method. The numerical simulation results show that the difference 
      between the target source and the MMA source generated using the proposed method 
      is less than 0.2%. Compared with the process window loss of the target source, 
      the process window loss of the MMA source generated by the proposed deconvolution 
      method is less than 0.5%. Compared with the traditional allocation method, the 
      runtime of the proposed method is less than 0.05 s and has improved by 1463 
      times.

TI  - The herbal compound Songyou Yin (SYY) inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma growth 
      and improves survival in models of chronic fibrosis via paracrine inhibition of 
      activated hepatic stellate cells.
PG  - 40068-80
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.5313 [doi]
AB  - Chronic fibrosis is a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). The pathological progression of hepatic fibrosis has been linked 
      to cellular processes that promote tumor growth and metastasis. Several recent 
      studies have highlighted the cross-talk between tumor cells and activated hepatic 
      stellate cells (aHSCs) in HCC. The herbal compound Songyou Yin (SYY) is known to 
      attenuate hepatoma cell invasion and metastasis via down-regulation of cytokine 
      secretion by aHSCs. However the underlying mechanism of SYY treatment in reversal 
      of hepatic fibrosis and metastasis of liver cancers is not known. In the current 
      study, a nude mouse model with liver fibrosis bearing orthotopic xenograft was 
      established and we found that SYY could reduce associated fibrosis, inhibit tumor 
      growth and improve survival. In the subcutaneous tumor model with fibrosis, we 
      found that SYY could inhibit liver cancer. In vitro, hepatoma cells incubated 
      with conditioned media (CM) from SYY treated aHSCs showed reduced proliferation, 
      decrease in colony formation and invasive potential. SYY treated group showed 
      altered gene expression, with 1205 genes up-regulated and 1323 genes 
      down-regulated. Gene cluster analysis indicated that 
      phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) was one of the key genes altered in the 
      expression profiles. PI3K related markers were all significantly down-regulated. 
      ELISA also indicated decreased secretion of cytokines which were regulated by 
      PI3K/AKT signaling after SYY treatment in the hepatic stellate cell line, LX2. 
      These data clearly demonstrate that SYY therapy inhibits HCC invasive and 
      metastatic potential and improves survival in nude mice models with chronic 
      fibrosis background via inhibition of cytokine secretion by activated hepatic 
      stellate cells.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor associated with a high 
      recurrence rate after hepatectomy. Recently, preoperative inflammatory and liver 
      function reserve indices were found to predict increased risk of recurrence and 
      decreased survival in HCC patients. This study aims to evaluate the ability of 
      the γ-glutamyl transpeptidase-to-albumin ratio (GAR) and aspartate 
      aminotransferase-to-lymphocyte ratio (ALRI), individually and in combination, to 
      predict the prognosis of HCC patients after hepatectomy.We retrospectively 
      reviewed 206 HCC patients who underwent radical resection at the General Hospital 
      of Ningxia Medical University from January 2011 to November 2016. Receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the 
      optimal cut-off value for GAR and ALRI. The Pearson Chi-Squared test was used to 
      analyze the correlations between GAR, ALRI and clinicopathological 
      characteristics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the 
      predictive value of these factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall 
      survival (OS). Survival rates were drawn according to the Kaplan-Meier method and 
      differences between subgroups were compared by the log-rank statistics.GAR and 
      ALRI were significantly correlated with gender, history of smoking, prothrombin 
      time, tumor diameter, T stage and early intrahepatic recurrence by the Pearson 
      Chi-Squared test (all P < .05). Univariate analysis indicated that T stage, GAR 
      and ALRI were significantly correlated with DFS and OS in HCC patients after 
      hepatectomy. Multivariate analysis illustrated that GAR and ALRI were 
      independently related to DFS and OS in HCC patients. Preoperative GAR > 0.946 or 
      ALRI > 18.734 predicted poor prognosis in HCC patients after hepatectomy. 
      Additionally, the predictive scope of GAR combined with ALRI was more sensitive 
      than that of either individual measurement alone.Our data indicate that there is 
      a close association between the clinicopathological characteristics in HCC 
      patients and increased GAR or ALRI. Higher levels of GAR and ALRI could 
      sensitively and specifically predict a poor prognosis in HCC patients after 
      hepatectomy. Furthermore, combined usage of GAR and ALRI could improve the 
      accuracy of this prediction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have a key role in fibrogenesis and in 
      the filtrates of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stroma, in which they are 
      remodeled and play a critical role in HCC progression. However, the precise role 
      of HSCs trending, infiltration and paracrine in orchestrating the stroma-derived 
      oxaliplatin-resistance in HCC is still vague. METHODS: The chemo-resistant models 
      were established to explore the correlation between HSC cells and the condition 
      of chemoresistance. The HCC clinical samples were collected to confirm this 
      phenomenon. Then, the relationship between secretory CCN3 from 
      oxaliplatin-resistant HCC and the infiltration of HSCs in associated HCC 
      microenvironment was evaluated. Finally, the role and mechanism of HSCs 
      remodeling in the orchestration of oxaliplatin-resistant HCC were explored. 
      RESULTS: The increased infiltration of HSCs and collagen accumulation were found 
      in the microenvironment of oxaliplatin-resistant HCC. The cDNA profiles of the 
      oxaliplatin-resistant HCC was reanalyzed, and CCN3 was one of the significantly 
      increased genes. In HCC clinical samples, the levels of CCN3 and α-SMA are 
      positively correlated, and high expression of CCN3 and α-SMA are positively 
      associated with malignant phenotype and poor prognosis. Then the enhanced 
      abilities of migration and proliferation of HSCs, and elevation of the cytokines 
      paracrine from HSCs relating to HCC malignancy were proved in vitro and in vivo, 
      and which were related to CCN3-ERK signaling pathway activation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      HSCs remodeling are positively related to CCN3 paracrine in hepatocellular 
      carcinoma, which orchestrated the stroma-derived resistance to chemotherapy in 
      HCC.

TI  - Organic nitrogen components in soils from southeast China.
PG  - 259-69
LID - 10.1631/jzus.B1200104 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the amounts of extractable organic nitrogen (EON), and 
      the relationships between EON and total extractable nitrogen (TEN), especially 
      the amino acids (AAs) adsorbed by soils, and a series of other hydrolyzed soil 
      nitrogen indices in typical land use soil types from southeast China. Under 
      traditional agricultural planting conditions, the functions of EON, especially 
      AAs in the rhizosphere and in bulk soil zones were also investigated. METHODS: 
      Pot experiments were conducted using plants of pakchoi (Brassica chinensis L.) 
      and rice (Oryza sativa L.). In the rhizosphere and bulk soil zone studies, 
      organic nitrogen components were extracted with either distilled water, 0.5 mol/L 
      K2SO4 or acid hydrolysis. RESULTS: K2SO4-EON constituted more than 30% of TEN 
      pools. K2SO4-extractable AAs accounted for 25% of EON pools and nearly 10% of TEN 
      pools in rhizosphere soils. Overall, both K2SO4-EON and extractable AAs contents 
      had positive correlations with TEN pools. CONCLUSIONS: EON represented a major 
      component of TEN pools in garden and paddy soils under traditional planting 
      conditions. Although only a small proportion of the EON was present in the form 
      of water-extractable and K2SO4-extractable AAs, the release of AAs from soil 
      exchangeable sites might be an important source of organic nitrogen (N) for plant 
      growth. Our findings suggest that the content of most organic forms of N was 
      significantly greater in rhizosphere than in bulk soil zone samples. However, it 
      was also apparent that the TEN pool content was lower in rhizosphere than in bulk 
      soil samples without added N.

TI  - Roflumilast enhances cisplatin-sensitivity and reverses cisplatin-resistance of 
      ovarian cancer cells via cAMP/PKA/CREB-FtMt signalling axis.
PG  - e12474
LID - 10.1111/cpr.12474 [doi]
LID - e12474
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We previously demonstrated the roflumilast inhibited cell 
      proliferation and increased cell apoptosis in ovarian cancer. In this study, we 
      aimed to investigate the roles of roflumilast in development of cisplatin 
      (DDP)-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer. METHODS: OVCAR3 and SKOV3 were 
      selected and the corresponding DDP-resistant cells were constructed. Cell 
      viability, proliferation, apoptosis, cycle were performed. Expression cAMP, PKA, 
      CREB, phosphorylation of CREB and FtMt were detected. The roles of roflumilast in 
      development of DDP-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer were confirmed by 
      xenograft model. RESULTS: Roflumilast + DDP inhibited cell proliferation, and 
      induced cell apoptosis and G0/G1 arrest in OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cells, roflumilast 
      induced expression of FtMt, the activity of cAMP and PKA and phosphorylation of 
      CREB in ovarian cancer cells and the above-effect were inhibited by H89. 
      Downregulation of CREB inhibited the roflumilast-increased DDP sensitivity of 
      ovarian cancer cells, and the roflumilast-induced FtMt expression and 
      phosphorylation of CREB. Also, roflumilast reversed cisplatin-resistance, and 
      induced expression of FtMt and activation of cAMP/PKA/CREB in DDP-resistant 
      ovarian cancer cells. Similarly, treated with H89 or downregulation of CREB 
      inhibited the changes induced by roflumilast. In vivo, roflumilast inhibited the 
      development of SKOV3 or SKOV3-DDP-R xenograft models. CONCLUSIONS: Roflumilast 
      enhanced DDP sensitivity and reversed the DDP resistance of ovarian cancer cells 
      via activation of cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway and upregulation of the downstream FtMt 
      expression, which has great promise in clinical treatment.

TI  - Paracrine effects of CCN3 from non-cancerous hepatic cells increase signaling and 
      progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 395

AB  - BACKGROUND: The liver microenvironment plays a key role in the progression and 
      metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Gene expression profiling of 
      non-cancerous hepatic tissues obtained from patients with metastatic HCC exhibit 
      a unique immune response signature, including upregulation of CCN3. However, the 
      role of CCN3 secreted from non-cancerous hepatic tissues in the progression of 
      HCC remains unclear. METHODS: Using tissue microarrays, we examined CCN3 in 
      non-cancerous hepatic tissues of patients with HCC and correlated expression with 
      clinical and pathological features. In addition, CCN3 localization and mechanisms 
      of HCC progression were investigated in tissues and cell lines. Finally, 
      correlations between CCN3 and cirrhosis were explored in patients. RESULTS: CCN3 
      was primarily localized to hepatic cells of non-cancerous hepatic tissues and was 
      associated with vascular invasion and poor prognosis in patients with HCC. CCN3 
      expression in non-cancerous hepatic tissues also correlated with the degree of 
      liver fibrosis. Compared with conditioned media from wild-type LO2 cells, 
      conditioned media from hepatic cell line LO2 activated by LX2 (aLO2-CM) induced 
      CCN3 expression and HCC cell proliferation and metastasis. Further, aLO2-CM 
      activated MAPK signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in HCC cells. 
      Finally, CCN3 was inversely related to cirrhosis in the prognosis of HCC and 
      negatively regulated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in vitro with downregulation 
      of α-SMA, TGF-β, and collagens. CONCLUSIONS: CCN3 was secreted from hepatic cells 
      activated by HSCs and increased MAPK signaling, EMT, proliferation and metastasis 
      of HCC cells. CCN3 was also inversely related to cirrhosis, regulating HSCs 
      through a negative feedback loop.

AB  - The influence of Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Exendin-4 on development of 
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is evaluated in the study. In vitro tests, 
      including acute toxicity test, cell colony formation assays, cells proliferation 
      and apoptosis, transwell assay, were performed. An ICC in situ tumor animal model 
      was established. Then, animals were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6): 
      control, Exendin-4 treatment, oxaliplatin treatment and Exendin-4-oxaliplatin 
      treatment. Animals in the Exendin-4 treatment and Exendin-4-oxaliplatin treatment 
      groups received a subcutaneous injection of Exendin-4 (100 μg/kg/day) for 1 week, 
      and then received oxaliplatin (10 mg/kg/week) by tail vein injection. Animals in 
      the control group received PBS. Immunohistochemistry tests were used for PCNA, 
      Ki67, Caspase 3 expression in tumor tissue. Results show that that, after 
      incubation of human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, HuCCTI and GLP-1, or HuCCTI 
      and Exendin-4, colony formation number was sharply decreased. However, GLP-1, 
      HuCCTI or Exendin-4 did not affect the colony of normal cells. Combination 
      treatment with oxaliplatin and Exendin-4 can significantly inhibit tumor cells' 
      proliferation and promote apoptosis. The combined effect is stronger than that of 
      oxaliplatin or Exendin-4. Combination treatment with oxaliplatin and Exendin4 can 
      significantly decrease Ki67 and PCNA proteins' expression in subcutaneous tumors 
      of nude mice. The inhibitory effect of Combination treatment with oxaliplatin and 
      Exendin4 is clearly stronger than that of oxaliplatin. In addition, Combination 
      treatment with oxaliplatin and Exendin4 can significantly increase Caspase3 
      protein positive expression. In short, these results show that combination 
      treatment with oxaliplatin and Exendin4 can inhibit tumor cells' proliferation, 
      and promote apoptosis.

AB  - Cancer is becoming the leading cause of death and a major public health problem. 
      Although many advanced treatment strategies are currently in use, the general 
      prognosis of cancer patients remains dismal due to the high frequency of 
      recurrence, metastasis. The identification of effective biomarkers is important 
      for predicting survival of cancer patients and improving treatment efficacy. In 
      this study, we comprehensively analyzed WNT1-inducible-signaling pathway protein 
      1 (WISP1) expression and explored its correlation with prognosis in pan-cancer 
      using tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER) and Gene Expression Profiling 
      Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2). We also examined correlations between WISP1 and 
      immunocyte infiltration using TIMER. We identified genes co-expressed with WISP1 
      using the LinkedOmics database and analyzed associated gene ontology using 
      Metascape. Finally, we constructed protein-protein interaction networks and 
      examined correlations between genes co-expressed with WISP1 and immunocyte 
      infiltration in pan-cancer. WISP1 level differed between human pan-cancer tissues 
      and normal tissues, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker. WISP1 
      expression was correlated with tumor purity and immunocyte infiltration, 
      especially monocyte-macrophage trafficking and M2 polarization. Genes 
      co-expressed with WISP1 were mainly associated with extracellular matrix 
      organization, with collagen members COL6A3, COL5A1, and COL8A1 being key genes 
      correlated with macrophage infiltration and M2 polarization in pan-cancer. 
      Conversely, in certain types of cancer with better prognoses, WISP1 was 
      associated with low M2 macrophage infiltration. These results suggest that WISP1 
      affect clinical prognosis through associations with tumor purity, immune cell 
      infiltration, and macrophage M2 polarization in pan-cancer, with collagen member 
      proteins may serving as effector molecules of WISP1.

LID - 975485
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term survival between laparoscopic surgery and 
      open surgery in patients with apparent early-stage uterine clear cell carcinoma 
      (UCCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 254 patients with apparent early-stage UCCC were 
      reviewed. Comparisons were made between patients who underwent laparoscopic 
      surgery versus those who underwent open surgery. Baseline data, 
      clinicopathological data, and oncological outcomes were analyzed. 5-year 
      disease-free survival (DFS) rate and 5-year overall survival (OS) rate were 
      estimated and compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Log-rank test. The 
      Cox proportional hazard regression model was employed to control the confounding 
      factors. RESULTS: 147 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery, and 107 patients 
      were managed by open surgery. No differences in terms of recurrence rate 
      (laparoscopy versus laparotomy: 10.9% versus 12.9%, P=0.842) and recurrence 
      pattern were observed. For patients who underwent open surgery and patients who 
      underwent laparoscopic surgery, the 5-year DFS rates and 5-year OS rate were 
      75.8% (95% CI: 65.8%-83.2%) and 69.1% (95% CI: 58.8%-77.4%), 66.0% (95% CI: 
      57.1%-73.5%) and 60.8% (95% CI: 52.0%-68.5%), respectively. The Cox proportional 
      hazards regression model shown that for apparent early-stage UCCC, the approach 
      of surgical staging was not an independent predictor for survival (laparoscopy 
      versus laparotomy: for DFS, aHR=1.06, 95% CI=0.64-1.75, P=0.826; for OS, 
      aHR=1.10, 95% CI=0.72-1.68, P=0.671). CONCLUSION: For apparent early-stage UCCC, 
      in terms of oncological survival, laparoscopic surgery was as safe as open 
      surgery.

LID - 10.1177/1534735415622011 [doi]
AB  - Objective Both the Chinese herbal compound Songyou Yin (SYY) and swimming 
      exercise have been shown to have protective effects against liver cancer in 
      animal models. In this study, we investigated whether SYY and moderate swimming 
      (MS) have enhanced effect on suppressing progression of liver cancer by 
      immunomodulation. Methods C57BL/6 mice were transplanted with Hepa1-6 murine 
      liver cancer cell lines and received treatment with SYY alone or SYY combined 
      with MS. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive metastatic foci in lungs 
      were imaged with a stereoscopic fluorescence microscope. Flow cytometry was used 
      to test the proportion of CD4 +, CD8 + T cells in peripheral blood and the 
      proportions of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Treg cells in peripheral blood, spleen, and 
      tumor tissues. Cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 level in serum was 
      detected by ELISA. Results SYY plus MS significantly suppressed the growth and 
      lung metastasis of liver cancer and prolonged survival in tumor-burdened mice. 
      SYY plus MS markedly raised the CD4 to CD8 ratio in peripheral blood and lowered 
      the serum TGF-β1 level and the proportions of Treg cells in peripheral blood, 
      spleen, and tumor tissue. The effects of the combined intervention were 
      significantly superior to SYY or MS alone. Conclusion The combined application of 
      SYY and MS exerted an enhanced effect on suppressing growth and metastasis of 
      liver cancer by strengthening immunity.

TI  - Advanced oxidation protein products induce hypertrophy and 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human proximal tubular cells through 
      induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the accumulation of advanced 
      oxidation protein products (AOPPs) is prevalent. Hypertrophy and 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tubular cells are associated with 
      the pathogenesis of CKD. However, whether AOPPs induce tubular-cell hypertrophy 
      and EMT is unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of AOPPs on human 
      proximal tubular cells (HK-2 cells) and the mechanisms underlying tubular-cell 
      hypertrophy and EMT in vitro. METHODS: The mRNA and protein expression of 
      CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP), glucose-regulated 
      protein (GRP) 78, p27, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and E-cadherin were 
      evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. Cell 
      cycle was detected by flow cytometry. Bicinchoninic acid method was performed to 
      measure total protein content. RESULTS: AOPP treatment upregulated total protein 
      expression, caused an increase in the percentage of G1-phase cells, and induced 
      the overexpression of p27 and α-SMA, lowered the expression of E-cadherin. 
      Furthermore, AOPP treatment induced the overexpression of GRP78 and CHOP. 
      Moreover, the aforementioned effects were reversed following the treatment of 
      cells with an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, 
      or salubrinal, which is an inhibitor of ER stress, whereas these effects were 
      produced after exposure to thapsigargin, an inducer of ER stress. CONCLUSION: Our 
      results suggest that AOPPs induced HK-2-cell hypertrophy and EMT by inducing ER 
      stress, which was likely mediated by ROS. These findings could facilitate the 
      development of novel therapeutic strategies for suppressing the progression of 
      CKD.

TI  - Melatonin promotes neuroprotection of induced pluripotent stem cells-derived 
      neural stem cells subjected to H(2)O(2)-induced injury in vitro.

AB  - Melatonin is a neurohormone mainly extracted from the pineal gland with 
      neuroprotective effects. It has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic 
      functions. However, the mechanism of melatonin against reactive oxygen species is 
      unclear. Here, we explore the potential proliferative and neuroprotective 
      mechanism of melatonin on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neural 
      stem cells (NSCs) exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). NSCs were induced from 
      iPSCs, then pretreated with 500 μM H(2)O(2), 1 μM melatonin, 1 μM melatonin 
      receptor antagonist (Luzindole), or 10 μM Phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) 
      inhibitor (LY294002). The results showed that melatonin stimulated proliferation 
      of iPSC-derived NSCs on H(2)O(2) exposure. Melatonin also markedly improved 
      stabilization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced the rate of 
      apoptosis. Treatment with Luzindole or LY294002 inhibited the increasing 
      proliferative and neuroprotective effects of melatonin on iPSC-derived NSCs with 
      H(2)O(2) treatment. Our results further demonstrated that these promotional 
      effects of melatonin were related with the activity of phosphorylation of AKT. 
      Therefore, these outcomes propose that melatonin protects iPSC-derived NSCs from 
      H(2)O(2)-induced injury through the mediation of melatonin receptor and PI3K/AKT 
      signaling pathway.

AB  - Reaction of europium sulfate octahydrate with 
      p-terphenyl-3,3″,5,5″-tetracarboxylic acid (H4ptptc) in a mixed solvent system 
      has afforded three new coordination polymers formulated as 
      {[Eu(ptptc)0.75(H2O)2]·0.5DMF·1.5H2O}n (1), {[Me2H2N]2 
      [Eu2(ptptc)2(H2O)(DMF)]·1.5DMF·7H2O}n (2), and {[Eu(Hptptc)(H2O)4]·0.5DMF·H2O}n 
      (3). Complex 1 exhibits a three-dimensional (3D) metal-organic framework based on 
      {Eu2(μ2-COO)2(COO)4}n chains, complex 2 shows a 3D metal-organic framework 
      constructed by [Eu2(μ2-COO)2(COO)6](2-) dimetallic subunits, and complex 3 
      features a 2D layer architecture assembling to 3D framework through π···π 
      interactions. All complexes exhibit the characteristic red luminescence of 
      Eu(III) ion. The triplet state of ligand H4ptptc matches well with the emission 
      level of Eu(III) ion, which allows the preparation of new optical materials with 
      enhanced luminescence properties. The luminescence properties of these complexes 
      are further studied in terms of their emission quantum yields, emission 
      lifetimes, and the radiative/nonradiative rates.

TI  - Arsenic trioxide induces differentiation of CD133+ hepatocellular carcinoma cells 
      and prolongs posthepatectomy survival by targeting GLI1 expression in a mouse 
      model.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/1756-8722-7-28 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a key role in the posthepatectomy 
      recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CD133+ HCC cells exhibit liver 
      CSC-like properties, and CSC differentiation-inducing therapy may lead these 
      cells to lose their self-renewal ability and may induce terminal differentiation, 
      which may in turn allow their malignant potential to be controlled. Because 
      arsenic trioxide (As₂O₃) increases remission rates and prolongs survival among 
      patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia by inducing differentiation and 
      apoptosis of leukemic cells, we hypothesized that As₂O₃ might also inhibit HCC 
      recurrence and prolong survival time after hepatectomy by inducing 
      differentiation of HCC CSCs. METHODS: We evaluated the As₂O₃ induced 
      differentiation of human HCC CSCs and its mechanism in vitro, and we investigated 
      the effects of treatment with As₂O₃ on recurrence rates and median survival in a 
      mouse xenograft model. RESULTS: We found that As₂O₃ induced HCC CSC 
      differentiation by down-regulating the expression of CD133 and some stemness 
      genes, thus inhibiting the cells' self-renewal ability and tumorigenic capacity 
      without inhibiting their proliferation in vitro. In vivo experiments indicated 
      that As₂O₃ decreased recurrence rates after radical resection and prolonged 
      survival in a mouse model. As₂O₃, which shows no apparent toxicity, may induce 
      HCC CSC differentiation by down-regulating the expression of GLI1. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We found that As₂O₃ induced HCC CSC differentiation, inhibited recurrence, and 
      prolonged survival after hepatectomy by targeting GLI1expression. Our results 
      suggest that the clinical safety and utility of As₂O₃ should be further 
      evaluated.

TI  - Sub-pixel position estimation algorithm based on Gaussian fitting and sampling 
      theorem interpolation for wafer alignment.
PG  - 9607-9618

AB  - Wafer alignment is the core technique of lithographic tools. 
      Image-processing-based wafer alignment techniques are commonly used in 
      lithographic tools. An alignment algorithm is used to analyze the alignment mark 
      image for obtaining the mark position. The accuracy and speed of the alignment 
      algorithm are very important for guaranteeing the overlay and throughput of 
      lithographic tools. The most commonly used algorithm in image-processing-based 
      alignment techniques is the self-correlation method. This method has a high 
      accuracy, but the calculation is complex, and the calculation speed is slow. In 
      this paper, we propose a sub-pixel position estimation algorithm based on 
      Gaussian fitting and sampling theorem interpolation. The algorithm first 
      reconstructs the alignment signal by sampling theorem interpolation and then 
      obtains the sub-pixel position of the mark by Gaussian fitting. The accuracy and 
      robustness of the algorithm are verified by testing the simulated marks and 
      experimentally captured marks. The repeat accuracy can reach 1/100 pixels, which 
      is in the same level with the self-correlation method. The calculation speed is 
      highly improved compared with the self-correlation method, which needs only about 
      1/3 of even short calculation time.

TI  - Splenic artery embolization changes the management of blunt splenic injury: an 
      observational analysis of 680 patients graded by the revised 2018 AAST-OIS.
PG  - 371-381
LID - 10.1007/s00464-022-09531-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the management of blunt splenic injury 
      (BSI) and highlight the role of splenic artery embolization (SAE). METHODS: We 
      conducted a retrospective review of all patients with BSI over 15 years. Splenic 
      injuries were graded by the 2018 revision of the American Association for the 
      Surgery of Trauma-Organ Injury Scale (AAST-OIS). Our hospital provide 24/7 
      in-house surgeries and 24/7 in-house interventional radiology facility. Patients 
      with BSI who arrived hypotensive and were refractory to resuscitation required 
      surgery and patients with vascular injury on abdominal computed tomography were 
      considered for SAE. RESULTS: In total, 680 patients with BSI, the number of 
      patients who underwent nonoperative management with observation (NOM-obs), SAE, 
      and surgery was 294, 234, and 152, respectively. The number of SAEs increased 
      from 4 (8.3%) in 2001 to 23 (60.5%) in 2015 (p < 0.0001); conversely, the number 
      of surgeries decreased from 21 (43.8%) in 2001 to 4 (10.5%) in 2015 (p = 0.001). 
      The spleen-related mortality rate of NOM-obs, SAEs, and surgery was 0%, 0.4%, and 
      7.2%, respectively. In the SAE subgroup, according to the 2018 AAST-OIS, 234 
      patients were classified as grade II, n = 3; III, n = 21; IV, n = 111; and V, 
      n = 99, respectively.; and compared with 1994 AST-OIS, 150 patients received a 
      higher grade and the total number of grade IV and V injuries ranged from 96 
      (41.0%) to 210 (89.7%) (p < 0.0001). On angiography, 202 patients who 
      demonstrated vascular injury and 187 achieved hemostasis after SAE with a 92.6% 
      success rate. Six of the 15 patients failed to SAE preserved the spleen after 
      second embolization with a 95.5% salvage rate. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the 
      superiority of the 2018 AAST-OIS and support the role of SAE in changing the 
      trend of management of BSI.

TI  - Herbal compound "Songyou Yin" attenuates hepatoma cell invasiveness and 
      metastasis through downregulation of cytokines secreted by activated hepatic 
      stellate cells.
PG  - 89
LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-13-89 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) play an important role in 
      the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we determined if 
      cytokines secreted in response to the herbal compound "Songyou Yin" (SYY) 
      treatment of aHSCs could influence invasiveness and metastatic capabilities of 
      hepatoma cells. METHODS: Primary rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were isolated, 
      activated, divided into SYY treated and untreated (nSYY) groups, and conditioned 
      media (CM-SYY and CM-nSYY, respectively) were collected. The hepatoma cell line, 
      McA-RH7777 was cultured for 4 weeks with SYY, CM-SYY, and CM-nSYY, designated 
      McA-SYY, McA-SYYCM and McA-nSYYCM. The invasiveness and metastatic capabilities 
      were evaluated using Matrigel invasion assay in vitro and pulmonary metastasis in 
      vivo. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and 
      vimentin protein levels in McA-SYYCM and McA-nSYYCM were evaluated by Western 
      blot. Cytokine levels in conditioned media were tested using enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Matrigel invasion assay indicated that the 
      number of McA-SYYCM cells passing through the basement membrane was less than in 
      McA-nSYYCM cells (P < 0.01). Similar results were also observed in vivo for lung 
      metastasis. McA-SYYCM cells showed less pulmonary metastasis capabilities than 
      McA-nSYYCM cells (P < 0.001). The reduced expression of MMP-2 and reversed 
      epithelial to mesenchymal transition with E-cadherin upregulation, and N-cadherin 
      and vimentin downregulation were also found in McA-SYYCM compared to McA-nSYYCM. 
      Metastasis-promoting cytokines hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-6, 
      transforming growth factor-β1, and vascular endothelial growth factor were 
      markedly decreased in CM-SYY compared to CM-nSYY. CONCLUSIONS: SYY attenuates 
      hepatoma cell invasiveness and metastasis capabilities through downregulating 
      cytokines secreted by activated hepatic stellate cells.

TI  - Study on the Mechanism of CCN2 Promoting Sorafenib Resistance in HCC and Its 
      Combined Intervention Strategy.
PG  - 45454
LID - 10.31083/FBL45454 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since its introduction in 2008, sorafenib has remained the standard 
      first-line systemic treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      Nevertheless, its clinical benefits are often compromised by the rapid emergence 
      of drug resistance. This study explores the molecular mechanisms underlying 
      sorafenib resistance, with particular emphasis on the involvement of connective 
      tissue growth factor (CCN2/CTGF) in the regulation of c-Met signaling pathways. 
      METHODS: We began by evaluating CCN2 expression levels in HCC tissue samples via 
      immunohistochemistry and analyzing their correlation with clinicopathological 
      characteristics. To functionally characterize CCN2, we established stable HCC 
      cell lines with either knockdown or overexpression of the gene using lentiviral 
      transduction. The effects of CCN2 on cellular proliferation and drug resistance 
      were evaluated using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. To 
      elucidate the downstream signaling mechanisms, a tyrosine kinase PCR array was 
      employed to identify expression changes within the tyrosine kinase superfamily 
      after CCN2 knockdown. Further investigation into the molecular mechanism by which 
      CCN2 promotes sorafenib resistance was conducted using real-time quantitative PCR 
      (RT-qPCR), western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Finally, the therapeutic 
      potential of co-targeting CCN2 and sorafenib was validated in a nude mouse 
      xenograft tumor model. RESULTS: Our results establish that CCN2 overexpression 
      significantly enhances HCC proliferation, while also inducing resistance to 
      sorafenib. Mechanistically, we identified that CCN2 binds to integrin αV, 
      triggering focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation, which in turn promotes 
      yes-associated protein (YAP) nuclear translocation and leads to the 
      transcriptional upregulation of c-Met. This proposed signaling axis was 
      consistently supported by tyrosine kinase PCR array, co-immunoprecipitation, and 
      western blot analyses. Ultimately, in vivo experiments confirmed that 
      simultaneously targeting CCN2 and administering sorafenib produces a synergistic 
      effect, markedly inhibiting tumor growth and restoring therapeutic sensitivity. 
      CONCLUSION: These results not only elucidate a novel CCN2/FAK/YAP/c-Met axis in 
      sorafenib resistance but also provide a mechanistic rationale for dual-targeting 
      strategies to improve outcomes in advanced HCC.

TI  - TMCO1 regulates energy metabolism and mitochondrial function of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma cells through TOMM20, affecting the growth of subcutaneous graft tumors 
      and infiltration of CAFs.
PG  - 1-15
LID - 10.1139/bcb-2024-0091 [doi]
AB  - This study mainly shows the role of endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane and 
      coiled coil domains 1 (TMCO1) in the regulatory mechanism of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). Invasion and migration capacity were detected by Transwell and 
      wound healing after TMCO1 and TOMM20 overexpression and knockdown, and 
      mitochondrial function was detected through reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
      mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), mitochondrial membrane 
      potential (MMP), and ATP production. A model of subcutaneous tumor formation in 
      nude mice was established to detect the effect of TMCO1 on tumor formation. The 
      results showed that overexpression of TMCO1 significantly promoted HCC cell 
      metastasis, promoted cell proliferation and ATP production, inhibited cell 
      apoptosis, mPTP opening and ROS production, mediated the increase of MMP level 
      and cytoskeletal remodeling. However, knocking down TMCO1 can have the opposite 
      effect. More importantly, knocking down TOMM20 can block the regulation effect of 
      TMCO1, and TOMM20 overexpression can alleviate the inhibitory effect of knocking 
      down TMCO1 on the development of liver cancer cells. In animal models, knockdown 
      of TMCO1 expression significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous implant 
      tumors. This suggests that TMCO1 may be a potential and valuable therapeutic 
      target for liver cancer.

TI  - Underwater Object Segmentation Based on Optical Features.
LID - 10.3390/s18010196 [doi]
LID - 196
AB  - Underwater optical environments are seriously affected by various optical inputs, 
      such as artificial light, sky light, and ambient scattered light. The latter two 
      can block underwater object segmentation tasks, since they inhibit the emergence 
      of objects of interest and distort image information, while artificial light can 
      contribute to segmentation. Artificial light often focuses on the object of 
      interest, and, therefore, we can initially identify the region of target objects 
      if the collimation of artificial light is recognized. Based on this concept, we 
      propose an optical feature extraction, calculation, and decision method to 
      identify the collimated region of artificial light as a candidate object region. 
      Then, the second phase employs a level set method to segment the objects of 
      interest within the candidate region. This two-phase structure largely removes 
      background noise and highlights the outline of underwater objects. We test the 
      performance of the method with diverse underwater datasets, demonstrating that it 
      outperforms previous methods.

TI  - Single-Cell Multi-Omics Reveals B2M-Mediated Myeloid Reprogramming and Constructs 
      a Predictive Model for Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence.
PG  - e71362

LID - e71362
AB  - Early recurrence remains a major challenge in the management of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC), yet its molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this 
      study, we applied an integrative multi-omics strategy at single-cell resolution 
      to explore potential drivers of early HCC recurrence (recurrence time < 2 years) 
      and to develop a predictive framework. By combining single-cell RNA sequencing, 
      proteomics, transcriptomics, and clinical feature analysis, we identified 14 
      relapse-associated proteins, including CD274, B2M, MYC, and CASP3, as candidate 
      risk factors. Transcriptomic profiling suggested the enrichment of pathways such 
      as MYC-TARGETS-V2 and INTERFERON-GAMMA-RESPONSE. Single-cell analysis indicated 
      reduced immune cell infiltration in recurrent tumors, with myeloid cells 
      (particularly cDC2 and macrophages) showing B2M-associated reprogramming 
      characterized by HLA downregulation and altered GAS6/PROS1 signaling, consistent 
      with tumor-associated macrophage-like phenotypes. A LASSO regression model based 
      on cDC2 and macrophage signature genes demonstrated moderate predictive 
      performance in both the training and validation cohorts (AUC > 0.65). Drug 
      sensitivity analyses further suggested that vandetanib may have the potential to 
      inhibit recurrence by targeting B2M-related pathways. These findings provide 
      evidence that B2M may contribute to remodeling of the immune microenvironment in 
      recurrent HCC. Our integrative single-cell multi-omics approach highlights a 
      possible mechanism of early recurrence and offers a preliminary predictive tool 
      with therapeutic implications.

      tomography.
PG  - 23605-23618
LID - 10.1364/OE.25.023605 [doi]
AB  - Accurate wavelength assignment is important for Fourier domain 
      polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography. Incorrect wavelength mapping 
      between the orthogonal horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarization channels 
      leads to broadening the axial point spread function and generating polarization 
      artifacts. To solve the problem, we propose an automatic spectral calibration 
      method by seeking the optimal calibration coefficient between wavenumber kH and 
      kV. The method first performs a rough calibration to get the relationship between 
      the wavelength λ and the pixel number x of the CCD for each channel. And then a 
      precise calibration is taken to bring both polarization interferograms in the 
      same k range through the optimal calibration coefficient. The optimal coefficient 
      is automatically obtained by evaluating the cross-correlation of A-line signals. 
      Simulations and experiments are implemented to demonstrate the performance of the 
      proposed method. The results show that, compared to the peaks method, the 
      proposed method is suitable in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian spectrums with a 
      higher calibration accuracy.

LID - 117
AB  - BACKGROUND: The overall response rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to 
      chemotherapy is poor. In our previous study, oxaliplatin-resistant HCC is found 
      to exhibit an enhanced stemness, and increased levels of CCN2 and LRP6, while the 
      role of CCN2 and LRP6 in the prognosis of HCC patients, and the interaction 
      regulation mechanism between CCN2 and LRP6 are still unclear. METHODS: The 
      expression levels of CCN2 and LRP6 were detected in large cohorts of HCCs, and 
      functional analyses of CCN2 and LRP6 were performed both in vitro and in vivo. 
      The roles of cell surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in the mutual 
      regulatory between CCN2 and LRP6 were verified in HCC, and the interventions of 
      low molecular weight heparin sodium (LMWH) were explored. RESULTS: CCN2 and LRP6 
      were overexpressed in HCCs, and the CCN2 and LRP6 levels were positively 
      associated with the malignant phenotypes and poor prognosis of HCCs. LRP6 could 
      significantly upregulate the expression of CCN2. Meanwhile, CCN2 was able to 
      enhance malignant phenotype of HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner through 
      binding with LRP6; and knock-down of LRP6 expression, perturbation of HSPGs, 
      co-incubation of CCN2 with LMWH could significantly block the adhesion of CCN2 to 
      LRP6. LMWH enhanced the therapeutic effect of oxaliplatin on HCC with a high CCN2 
      expression. CONCLUSIONS: CCN2 plays a promoting role in HCC progression through 
      activating LRP6 in a HSPGs-dependent manner. Heparin in combination with 
      chemotherapy has a synergic effect and could be a treatment choice for HCCs with 
      a high CCN2 expression.

      single crystal X-ray analyses and further characterized by infrared spectra, 
      elemental analyses, powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analyses and 
      photoluminescent spectra. Across this series, the π···π interactions have a 
      dramatic impact on the self-assembly of these entanglement structures, in either 
      case it can exert an important structure-directing role. In addition, the 
      disposition of pyridine nitrogen atoms in ligands also plays a large role in 
      structure direction in this system. Complex 1 is a 2D + 2D→3D inclined 
      polycatenated coordination polymer based on the resulting array of 2D (6,3) 
      layers constructed by 1D→2D π···π directed self-assembly. Complex 2 is assembled 
      into a 3D framework by means of 1D + 1D→3D mutual interdigitation based on 1D→1D 
      self-assembly driven by π···π stacking interactions. Complex 3 shows a 2D + 2D→3D 
      interdigital network involving 2D + 2D→2D parallel interpenetrated and 2D + 2D→2D 
      interdigital (4,4) layer motifs. Complex 4 displays a 2D + 2D→3D polythreaded 
      framework based on a 2D (4,4) network comprised of alternating rings and rods. 
      Complex 5 is a (3,4)-connected 3D framework with topology (4.8(2).10(3))(4.8(2)). 
      In comparison with covalently connected entanglements, such π···π directing 
      self-assembly of entanglements are far less explored, especially, polycatenane 
      based on 1D chain motifs and polythread based on 2D layer motifs are rarely 
      reported. Furthermore, the luminescent properties of complexes 1-5 at room 
      temperature have also been studied in detail herein.

TI  - Jones pupil metrology of lithographic projection lens and its optimal 
      configuration in the presence of error sources.
PG  - 4629-4647
LID - 10.1364/OE.27.004629 [doi]
AB  - Mueller matrix imaging polarimeter (MMIP) can be used to measure the polarization 
      aberration (PA) of a lithographic projector in the form of the Mueller pupil, 
      while the Jones pupil is required for lithographic imaging simulations, 
      projection lens design and PA evaluation. In this paper, a Jones pupil 
      measurement method of lithographic projection lens is proposed. The measurement 
      device of the method is the same as an MMIP, but a new polarimetric measurement 
      equation is derived to solve the Jones pupil directly from the Kronecker product 
      of the Jones matrix and the measured intensities. Two new polarimeter 
      configurations with the minimum condition number are designed to further improve 
      the accuracy in the presence of error sources. The performance of the method is 
      evaluated by measurement errors of a typical Jones pupil in the presence of error 
      sources. Comparisons between the proposed method and the conventional method, in 
      which the Jones pupil is converted from the Mueller pupil measured by MMIP, are 
      given. The results validate that the measurement accuracy of the Jones pupil is 
      significantly improved without increasing the complexity of existing measurement 
      systems.

TI  - MED10 as a Novel Oncogenic Driver in HCC: Promoting Cell Cycle Progression and 
      Proliferation Through RAF1 Activation.
PG  - 39944
LID - 10.31083/FBL39944 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mediator complex subunit 10 (MED10) serves as a critical regulator of 
      eukaryotic gene expression by facilitating RNA polymerase II activity. Our 
      investigation aims to characterize MED10's functional contributions and 
      underlying molecular pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. 
      METHODS: MED10 expression patterns in HCC and their correlation with 
      clinicopathological parameters and patient outcomes were examined using 
      bioinformatics databases and immunohistochemistry. Subsequently, we 
      systematically investigated the biological functions of MED10 in the malignant 
      progression of HCC through comprehensive in vitro experiments, including 
      assessments of cell migration (transwell and wound healing assays), proliferative 
      capacity (cell counting kit-8, colony formation, and 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine 
      assays), and cell cycle progression (flow cytometry analysis). Furthermore, we 
      elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms using real-time quantitative PCR 
      (RT-qPCR), western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and public database 
      analyses. Furthermore, an in vivo subcutaneous xenograft model was employed to 
      validate MED10's impact on tumor growth. RESULTS: The results revealed a marked 
      increase in MED10 expression levels within HCC tissues, showing a strong 
      association with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Mechanistically, MED10 induced 
      the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhanced HCC cell migration. 
      Moreover, MED10 overexpression drives HCC cell cycle progression and 
      proliferation by activating rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma 1 (RAF1), a process 
      potentially mediated through the mitogen-activated protein kinase 
      (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/cellular myelocytomatosis 
      oncogene (c-Myc) signaling axis. CONCLUSION: MED10 promotes HCC cell migration 
      and EMT but, more importantly, also drives cell cycle progression and 
      proliferation via RAF1 activation, and is related to the MEK/ERK/c-Myc axis.

TI  - Er(3+)-doped YbPO(4) up-conversion porous nanospheres for UCL/CT bimodal imaging 
      in vivo and chemotherapy.
PG  - 6508-6516
LID - 10.1039/c4tb00880d [doi]
AB  - The combined use nanotechnology and medical technologies holds great promise for 
      the development and improvement of various theranostic media. Here, based on a 
      facile hydrothermal method, polyethyleneimine (PEI) functionalized YbPO(4):Er 
      up-conversion porous nanospheres (UCPSs) were fabricated, which combined the 
      capabilities of up-conversion luminescence (UCL)/X-ray computed tomography (CT) 
      bimodal imaging and drug delivery. The resulting hydrophilic PEI functionalized 
      YbPO(4):Er UCPSs (PEI-UCPSs) showed uniform morphology and high crystallinity. 
      Moreover, PEI-UCPSs possessed high drug loading capacity because of their large 
      specific surface area, which was confirmed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) 
      experiment. Cellular experiments indicated that the PEI-UCPSs had low 
      cytotoxicity and confirmed the performance of the pH-mediated cancer targeting of 
      PEI-UCPSs@DOX. Importantly, because of the ideal UCL property and high CT 
      contrast both in vitro and in vivo, YbPO(4):Er PEI-UCPSs could be used as an 
      optical probe and a contrast agent for optical and CT imaging, forming a 
      promising platform for simultaneous bioimaging and drug delivery.

TI  - Conductance Interplay in Ion Concentration Polarization across 1D Nanochannels: 
      Microchannel Surface Shunt and Nanochannel Conductance.
PG  - 1252-1259
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.9b04417 [doi]
AB  - Ion concentration polarization has received much interest in the past decade for 
      lab-on-a-chip applications, primarily preconcentration of biomolecules and water 
      desalination. Studying the basic phenomenon in microfluidics has also generated 
      new knowledge, which could be pivotal in the design of novel devices. Many 
      studies, however, have focused on designs featuring nanoslits/slots or 
      surface-patterned ion-selective membranes whereas the characteristics of 1D 
      nanochannels are still lacking. Here, we report on ion concentration polarization 
      across highly ordered 1D nanochannels in isolation as well as in array formation. 
      Intriguingly, the nanochannels in isolation exhibit a linear current-voltage 
      characteristic at low salt concentrations despite the confirmed presence of 
      ion-depletion zone, which is associated with the diffusion-limited transport and 
      the consequent nonlinearity in the classical sense. The characteristic in array 
      formation breaks away from the linearity with a peculiar dip in current for a 
      critical salt concentration in the dilute limit. We describe these findings based 
      on the interplay between the nanochannel conductance and the conductance of the 
      neighboring microchannel walls (the so-called surface shunt). Also, the 
      nanochannel transport is identified with the mobility of protons more closely 
      than that of salt cations. We attribute fast transport to phosphorus-doped 
      silicate glass, the nanochannel material known to have very fine pores likely to 
      be populated with protons as a result of moisture and carbon dioxide adsorption 
      from the air. The nanochannels possess a tubular profile 70 nm in nominal 
      diameter and fabricated through thermal reflow of doped glass on silicon without 
      using advanced lithography.

TI  - Silica-coated bismuth sulfide nanorods as multimodal contrast agents for a 
      non-invasive visualization of the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - 12581-91
LID - 10.1039/c5nr03068d [doi]
AB  - Non-invasive and real-time imaging of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is 
      particularly desirable for research and clinical studies of patients with 
      symptoms arising from gastrointestinal diseases. Here, we designed and fabricated 
      silica-coated bismuth sulfide nanorods (Bi2S3@SiO2 NRs) for a non-invasive 
      spatial-temporally imaging of the GI tract. The Bi2S3 NRs were synthesized by a 
      facile solvothermal method and then coated with a SiO2 layer to improve their 
      biocompatibility and stability in the harsh environments of the GI tract, such as 
      the stomach and the small intestine. Due to their strong X-ray- and near 
      infrared-absorption abilities, we demonstrate that, following oral administration 
      in mice, the Bi2S3@SiO2 NRs can be used as a dual-modal contrast agent for the 
      real-time and non-invasive visualization of NRs distribution and the GI tract via 
      both X-ray computed tomography (CT) and photoacoustic tomography (PAT) 
      techniques. Importantly, integration of PAT with CT provides complementary 
      information on anatomical details with high spatial resolution. In addition, we 
      use Caenorhabditis Elegans (C. Elegans) as a simple model organism to investigate 
      the biological response of Bi2S3@SiO2 NRs by oral administration. The results 
      indicate that these NRs can pass through the GI tract of C. Elegans without 
      inducing notable toxicological effects. The above results suggest that Bi2S3@SiO2 
      NRs pave an alternative way for the fabrication of multi-modal contrast agents 
      which integrate CT and PAT modalities for a direct and non-invasive visualization 
      of the GI tract with low toxicity.

AB  - A series of novel two-dimensional (2D) lanthanide coordination polymers with 
      4-hydroxyquinoline-2-carboxylate (H(2)hqc) ligands, 
      [Ln(Hhqc)(3)(H(2)O)](n)·3nH(2)O (Ln = Eu (1), Tb (2), Sm (3), Nd (4), and Gd (5)) 
      and [Ln(Hhqc)(ox)(H(2)O)(2)](n) (Ln = Eu (6), Tb (7), Sm (8), Tm (9), Dy (10), Nd 
      (11), Yb (12), and Gd (13); H(2)ox = oxalic acid), have been synthesized under 
      hydrothermal conditions. Complexes 1-5 are isomorphous, which can be described as 
      a two-dimensional (2D) hxl/Shubnikov network based on Ln(2)(CO(2))(4) 
      paddle-wheel units, and the isomorphous complexes 6-13 feature a 2D decker layer 
      architecture constructed by Ln-ox infinite chains cross-linked alternatively by 
      bridging Hhqc(-) ligands. The room-temperature photoluminescence spectra of 
      complexes Eu(III) (1 and 6), Tb(III) (2 and 7), and Sm(III) (3 and 8) exhibit 
      strong characteristic emissions in the visible region, whereas Nd(III) (4 and 11) 
      and Yb(III) (12) complexes display NIR luminescence upon irradiation at the 
      ligand band. Moreover, the triplet state of H(2)hqc matches well with the 
      emission level of Eu(III), Tb(III), and Sm(III) ions, which allows the 
      preparation of new optical materials with enhanced luminescence properties.

TI  - [Correlation between TMEM39A gene polymorphism and systemic lupus erythematosus 
      in Chinese Han patients].
PG  - 556-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs) of the transmembrane protein 39A (TMEM39A) at the loci 1880G/A, 2442T/G, 
      and 2456A/T and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Chinese Han patients. 
      METHODS: TMEM39A gene polymorphisms at 3 loci (1880G/A, 2442T/G, 2456 A/T) were 
      analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism 
      (PCR-RFLP) in 110 Chinese Han patients with SLE and 80 normal control subjects, 
      and the allele and genotype frequencies were compared by Chi-square test between 
      the two groups. RESULTS: Both the genotype frequencies (AA, GA and GG) and allele 
      frequencies (A and G) at 1880G/A differed significantly between SLE cases and the 
      normal controls (P=0.002 and P=0.044, respectively). The two groups also showed 
      significant differences in the genotype frequencies (GG, TG and TT) (P=0.001) and 
      allele frequencies (G and T) (P=0.041) at 2442T/G. No significant differences 
      were found in the genotype frequencies (TT, AT and AA) or allele frequencies (T 
      and A) at 2456A/T between the two groups (P>0.05). The allele and genotype 
      frequencies of the 3 SNPs showed no significant differences between lupus 
      nephritis (LN) patients and non-LN patients. CONCLUSION: The TMEM39A 
      polymorphisms at 1880G/A and 2442T/G, but not at 2456 A/T gene, may be associated 
      with the susceptibility to SLE in Chinese Han population. The genotype or allele 
      frequencies of the 3 SNPs have no effect on the incidence of lupus nephritis.

TI  - [Advanced oxidation protein products induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 
      in cultured human proximal tubular epithelial cells via oxidative stress].
PG  - 659-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of advanced oxidation protein products 
      (AOPP) on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cultured human proximal 
      tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) and explore the mechanism. METHODS: HK-2 cells 
      treated with 50, 100, 200, and 400 µg/ml AOPP or 50 µg/m bovine serum albumin 
      (BSA) for 24 h, or with 200 µg/ml AOPP for 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h were 
      examined for the protein expression of α-SMA and E-cadherin. In cells pretreated 
      with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) or cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase (C-SOD), the 
      effects of 50 µg/ml BSA and 200 µg/ml AOPP were assessed on the expressions of 
      α-SMA and E-cadherin, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
      activity, catalase (CAT) activity, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) activity. 
      RESULTS: AOPP treatment up-regulated α-SMA expression and down-regulated 
      E-cadherin expression in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. AOPP exposure of the 
      cells resulted in increased MDA level and lowered activities of SOD, CAT and 
      GSH-PX. DPI and C-SOD partially attenuated the effects of AOPP on α-SMA, 
      E-cadherin, MDA, SOD, CAT and GSH-px. CONCLUSION: AOPP can induce EMT in cultured 
      HK-2 cells via oxidative stress, and this effect can be attenuated by inhibiting 
      the activation of NADPH oxidase and using antioxidants to delay the progression 
      of renal interstitial fibrosis.

TI  - Zernike polynomials as a basis for modal fitting in lateral shearing 
      interferometry: a discrete domain matrix transformation method.
PG  - 5884-91
LID - 10.1364/AO.55.005884 [doi]
AB  - A Zernike-polynomials-based wavefront reconstruction method for lateral shearing 
      interferometry is proposed. Shear matrices are calculated using matrix 
      transformation instead of mathematical derivation. Simulation results show that 
      the shear matrices calculated using the proposed method are the same as those 
      obtained from mathematical derivation. The advantage of the proposed method is 
      that high order shear matrices can be obtained easily; thus, wavefront 
      reconstruction can be extended to higher order Zernike terms, and reconstruction 
      accuracy can be improved.

TI  - Development and application of an early warning model for predicting early 
      mortality following stent placement in malignant biliary obstruction: A 
      comparative analysis of logistic regression and artificial neural network 
      approaches.
PG  - 237
LID - 10.3892/ol.2025.14983 [doi]
LID - 237
AB  - Patients with malignant biliary obstruction (MBO) are often treated with 
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) combined with biliary stent 
      placement for tumor progression. However, certain patients die within 30 days 
      after the procedure, increasing healthcare resource consumption and patient 
      burden. Therefore, the development of early mortality prediction models is 
      important for optimizing treatment decisions. The present study retrospectively 
      analyzed the clinical data of 285 patients with MBO, including demographic 
      information, laboratory indicators and tumor-related factors. Logistic regression 
      and artificial neural network (ANN) models were used to construct a prediction 
      tool, and the model performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), 
      accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The logistic regression model, which 
      identified the cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level and a history of previous ERCP 
      surgery as independent risk factors, had an AUC of 0.727 and an accuracy of 
      65.0%. The ANN model, which combined five variables, namely CA19-9, history of 
      previous ERCP surgery, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), liver metastasis and 
      carcinoembryonic antigen, demonstrated that NLR was the most weighted predictor. 
      Furthermore, the ANN model had an AUC of 0.813, an accuracy of 88.2% and a 
      specificity that was markedly higher than that of the logistic regression model 
      (95.5 vs. 83.3%). However, the ANN model was revealed to be slightly less 
      sensitive compared with the logistic regression model (61.1 vs. 61.2%). In 
      conclusion, compared with logistic regression, the ANN model had a greater 
      performance level in terms of predictive power and specificity, and is suitable 
      for capturing complex non-linear relationships. However, its complexity and risk 
      of overfitting need to be further optimized. The present study provides a new 
      tool for the accurate prediction of the risk of early death after ERCP in 
      patients with MBO, which could help improve individualized treatment strategies.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a significant threat as 
      a leading cause of nosocomial infections, inflicting severe complications and 
      fatalities worldwide. Its rising prevalence has become a major public health 
      concern as its resistance to common antibiotics complicates treatments, placing 
      additional burden on healthcare systems. Microbial culture is the "gold standard" 
      for diagnosing MRSA; however, this method is time-consuming and labor-intensive, 
      often leading to prolonged delays in diagnosis and treatment. In contrast, 
      nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) dramatically reduce diagnostic times to 
      mere hours, while maintaining high sensitivity and specificity. Bringing NAATs to 
      the point of care can facilitate timely treatment decisions and yet requires a 
      compact "sample-to-answer" system whose development has long been hindered by the 
      required sample preparation for these tests. Here, we present such a system 
      detecting MRSA in human serum through a simple microfluidic chip, achieving a 
      limit of detection of 1 CFU per reaction and a turnaround time of just 45 min. 
      The chip effectively overcomes the sample preparation challenge with an 
      innovative use of a sieve, a dense array of micropillars with submicrometer gaps. 
      Along with associated reservoirs, this sieve integrates bacterial lysis, 
      reagent-free electrophoretic purification and loop-mediated isothermal 
      amplification (LAMP) of nucleic acids with colorimetric detection visible to the 
      naked eye. Within the sieve, nucleic acids are selectively driven by rotating 
      electric fields and focused near the sieve center while steady electric fields 
      remove all contaminants, without the need for reagents. The system shows great 
      potential for point-of-care diagnostics.

TI  - Chronic hepatitis B infection in an Australian antenatal population: 
      seroprevalence and opportunities for better outcomes.
PG  - 998-1001
LID - 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2009.05841.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the antenatal population, screening for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
      carrier status is routinely undertaken to guide preventative measures for the 
      newborn. There is scarce information in the literature, however, regarding the 
      subsequent management of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive mothers. 
      AIMS AND METHODS: Thus, we undertook this retrospective study to (i) determine 
      the prevalence of HBsAg positivity among mothers attending two teaching hospital 
      birth centers; (ii) determine whether HBsAg mothers received HBV education and 
      underwent further evaluation of HBV infectivity status; and (iii) determine 
      whether these mothers had further follow up for HBV infection post delivery. 
      RESULTS: Between January 2003 and December 2006, 14, 857 mothers were screened 
      for hepatitis B virus infection. Among these, 295 mothers were positive with 
      HBsAg seroprevalence of 2%. A more detailed review of the available 206 medical 
      records revealed that the majority (78%) had previous documentation of infection 
      in earlier pregnancies. However none had received education regarding HBV 
      infectivity. In addition, liver function tests were only performed in 78% of the 
      mothers while Hepatitis B e antigen was tested in 65% of cases. Further, 93% of 
      the mothers had no documentation of further follow up plans or referrals for 
      their HBV infection. CONCLUSION: It is clear that chronic HBV infection is 
      prevalent in the antenatal population. However, there are no strategies to ensure 
      that infected mothers subsequently undergo further education for HBV or 
      evaluation of infectivity. Clearly strategies are required to ensure improved 
      follow up of hepatitis B infected mothers.

TI  - ["Bu-yang huanwu tang" inhibited the pathogentic process of atherosclerosis 
      induced by cholesterol-rich diet in rabbits].
PG  - 33-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: "Bu-yang huanwu tang", a decoction of Chinese herbs 
      widely used in the treatment for cardio- and cerebro-vascular diseases, has been 
      demonstrated to be able to inhibit platelet adhesion and aggregation, to lower 
      blood lipids, to regulate vascular tone from animal experiments. The aim of this 
      study is to determine whether this decoction inhibits the pathogentic process of 
      atherosclerosis induced by cholesterol-rich diet in rabbits. METHODS: Three 
      groups of rabbits received the following different diets for 9 weeks: 1. standard 
      diet; 2. atherogenic diet(standard diet plus 1% cholesterol and 3.3% fat); 3. 
      atherogenic diet plus this decoction(5 g.kg-1.d-1). Plasma lipids, 6-keto-PGF1 
      alpha, endothelin levels were detected and the histological atherosclerotic 
      changes were evaluated. RESULTS: This decoction inhibited the progression of 
      aortic and abdominal aortic intimal plaques and reduced aortic intimal 
      thickening. CONCLUSION: The anti-atherogenic mechanism might be related to the 
      decrease of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides and the increase of PGI2. The 
      facts suggest that "Bu-yang huanwu tang" has antiatherogenic and antithrombotic 
      effects.

TI  - NSUN5 as a Prognostic Biomarker Correlates with Malignant Phenotype and 
      Therapeutic Target in Glioma.
PG  - e71211
LID - 10.1002/brb3.71211 [doi]
LID - e71211
AB  - BACKGROUND: NSUN5 is a conserved RNA methyltransferase whose oncogenic role has 
      been demonstrated in various cancers. However, its function and prognostic value 
      in gliomas remain unclear. METHODS: In this study, we systematically analyzed the 
      expression and functional associations of NSUN5 in glioma using data from The 
      Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. 
      A total of 117 machine learning algorithm combinations were employed to construct 
      and validate a prognostic model for glioma patients. In addition, in vitro 
      experiments were performed to further validate the expression and biological 
      functions of NSUN5. RESULTS: NSUN5 expression is significantly upregulated in 
      glioma and is positively associated with tumor malignancy and poor prognosis. 
      Immune infiltration analysis revealed a marked increase in M2 macrophages in the 
      NSUN5 high-expression group, and NSUN5 levels were positively correlated with the 
      expression of multiple inhibitory immune checkpoints. In addition, drug 
      sensitivity analysis and molecular docking suggested that NSUN5 may influence the 
      response to Olaparib. Finally, based on NSUN5-associated genes, we constructed 
      117 machine learning models and identified the optimal prognostic model, STRICOM, 
      which demonstrated robust predictive performance for patient survival. 
      CONCLUSION: High NSUN5 expression is closely associated with poor prognosis in 
      glioma patients, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and 
      therapeutic target.

      profilometry and interferometry.
PG  - 7718-25
LID - 10.1364/AO.55.007718 [doi]
AB  - A method based on a nonsubsampled contourlet transform, which is an overcomplete 
      transform with multiresolution, directionality, and shift-invariance properties, 
      is proposed to extract the fundamental frequency component of an optical fringe 
      pattern in profilometry and interferometry. The nonsubsampled contourlet 
      transform method overcomes the disadvantages of the original contourlet transform 
      method, which lacks the shift-invariance property. Besides, it improves the 
      frequency selectivity. A strategy is developed to automatically determine the 
      optimal decomposition scale for removing the background intensity and suppressing 
      the noise of the fringe pattern. The proposed method is precise, effective, and 
      possesses a strong noise immune ability. Simulations and experiments verify the 
      validity, and show the superiorities of the proposed method.

TI  - [The academic trend of Oriental medicine during the Japanese colonial period as 
      observed through the publication of medical books].
PG  - 77-105
AB  - This thesis examines the academical trend of Oriental Medicine in the Japanese 
      colonial period observed through medical books published during the Japanese 
      colonial period. This is a period in which Western Medicine was introduced, and 
      due to the lean-to-one-side policy by the Japanese, Western Medicine became the 
      mainstream medical science while Oriental Medicine was pushed to the outskirts. 
      Even after all this, the academic activity was flourishing during this period 
      compared to any other periods. This article is divided into various chapters each 
      with its own theme in order to understand the academic trend of Oriental Medicine 
      during the Japanese colonial period. Focusing on the publication of medical 
      books, this article is divided and observed according to various themes such as 
      the study of Dong-Eui-Bo-Gam (see text), the study of Bang-Yak-Hap-Pyeun (see 
      text), the study of Sang-Han-Ron (see text), the study of Sa-sang (see text) 
      constitutional medicine, the study of Eui-Hak-Ip-Mun (see text), the study about 
      Bu-Yang-Ron (see text), On-Bo-Ron (see text), and pediatrics, compromise between 
      Western and Oriental Medicine, the study of experience medicine, the study of 
      acupuncture and moxibustion, and etc.
