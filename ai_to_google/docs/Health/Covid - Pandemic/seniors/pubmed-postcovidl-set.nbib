AB  - PURPOSE: Treatments for myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome 
      can be adapted for post-COVID-19 condition. Our aim was to compare treatments in 
      patients from our post-COVID-19 clinic. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective 
      cohort study and included consecutive patients enrolled in our post-COVID-19 
      clinic. We included patients who received low-dose naltrexone, amitriptyline, 
      duloxetine, and physical therapy, and evaluated improvements in fatigue, pain, 
      dyspnea, and brain fog recorded in the electronic health record. We calculated 
      the adjusted relative hazard of improvement using Cox proportional models. We 
      adjusted for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and prior COVID-19 
      hospitalization. FINDINGS: We included the first 108 patients with post-COVID-19 
      enrolled in the clinic. Most of the patients received amitriptyline. The relative 
      hazard of improvement for those taking low-dose naltrexone was 5.04 (95% CI, 
      1.22-20.77; P = 0.02) compared with physical therapy alone. Both fatigue and pain 
      were improved in patients taking low-dose naltrexone; only fatigue was improved 
      in patients taking amitriptyline. IMPLICATIONS: Post-COVID-19 condition symptoms 
      may improve in patients taking medications adapted from myalgic encephalomyelitis 
      and chronic fatigue syndrome. Randomized controlled trials should evaluate these 
      medications and translational studies should further evaluate their mechanisms of 
      action.

AB  - The global prevalence of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC) 
      stands at approximately 43 % among individuals who have previously had acute 
      COVID-19. In contrast, in the United States, the National Center for Health 
      Statistics (NCHS) estimates that around 11 % of individuals who have been 
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 go on to experience long COVID. The underlying causes of 
      PASC remains under investigation, and there are no currently established 
      FDA-approved therapies. One of the leading hypotheses for the cause of PASC is 
      the persistent activation of innate immune cells with increase systemic 
      inflammation. Naltrexone is a medication with anti-inflammatory and 
      immunomodulatory properties that has been used in other conditions that overlap 
      with PASC. We performed a retrospective review of a clinical cohort of 59 
      patients at a single academic center who received low-dose naltrexone (LDN) 
      off-label as a potential therapeutic intervention for PASC. The use of LDN was 
      associated with a fewer number of symptoms, improved clinical symptoms (fatigue, 
      post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, and abnormal sleep pattern), and a 
      better functional status. This observation warrants testing in rigorous, 
      randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials.

AB  - Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC, "Long COVID") pose a significant global 
      health challenge. The pathophysiology is unknown, and no effective treatments 
      have been found to date. Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain the 
      etiology of PASC, including viral persistence, chronic inflammation, 
      hypercoagulability, and autonomic dysfunction. Here, we propose a mechanism that 
      links all four hypotheses in a single pathway and provides actionable insights 
      for therapeutic interventions. We find that PASC are associated with serotonin 
      reduction. Viral infection and type I interferon-driven inflammation reduce 
      serotonin through three mechanisms: diminished intestinal absorption of the 
      serotonin precursor tryptophan; platelet hyperactivation and thrombocytopenia, 
      which impacts serotonin storage; and enhanced MAO-mediated serotonin turnover. 
      Peripheral serotonin reduction, in turn, impedes the activity of the vagus nerve 
      and thereby impairs hippocampal responses and memory. These findings provide a 
      possible explanation for neurocognitive symptoms associated with viral 
      persistence in Long COVID, which may extend to other post-viral syndromes.

      months (COVID-OUT): a multicentre, randomised, quadruple-blind, parallel-group, 
      phase 3 trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-COVID-19 condition (also known as long COVID) is an emerging 
      chronic illness potentially affecting millions of people. We aimed to evaluate 
      whether outpatient COVID-19 treatment with metformin, ivermectin, or fluvoxamine 
      soon after SARS-CoV-2 infection could reduce the risk of long COVID. METHODS: We 
      conducted a decentralised, randomised, quadruple-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 
      trial (COVID-OUT) at six sites in the USA. We included adults aged 30-85 years 
      with overweight or obesity who had COVID-19 symptoms for fewer than 7 days and a 
      documented SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR or antigen test within 3 days before 
      enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned via 2 × 3 parallel factorial 
      randomisation (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive metformin plus ivermectin, metformin plus 
      fluvoxamine, metformin plus placebo, ivermectin plus placebo, fluvoxamine plus 
      placebo, or placebo plus placebo. Participants, investigators, care providers, 
      and outcomes assessors were masked to study group assignment. The primary outcome 
      was severe COVID-19 by day 14, and those data have been published previously. 
      Because the trial was delivered remotely nationwide, the a priori primary sample 
      was a modified intention-to-treat sample, meaning that participants who did not 
      receive any dose of study treatment were excluded. Long COVID diagnosis by a 
      medical provider was a prespecified, long-term secondary outcome. This trial is 
      complete and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04510194. FINDINGS: 
      Between Dec 30, 2020, and Jan 28, 2022, 6602 people were assessed for eligibility 
      and 1431 were enrolled and randomly assigned. Of 1323 participants who received a 
      dose of study treatment and were included in the modified intention-to-treat 
      population, 1126 consented for long-term follow-up and completed at least one 
      survey after the assessment for long COVID at day 180 (564 received metformin and 
      562 received matched placebo; a subset of participants in the metformin vs 
      placebo trial were also randomly assigned to receive ivermectin or fluvoxamine). 
      1074 (95%) of 1126 participants completed at least 9 months of follow-up. 632 
      (56·1%) of 1126 participants were female and 494 (43·9%) were male; 44 (7·0%) of 
      632 women were pregnant. The median age was 45 years (IQR 37-54) and median BMI 
      was 29·8 kg/m(2) (IQR 27·0-34·2). Overall, 93 (8·3%) of 1126 participants 
      reported receipt of a long COVID diagnosis by day 300. The cumulative incidence 
      of long COVID by day 300 was 6·3% (95% CI 4·2-8·2) in participants who received 
      metformin and 10·4% (7·8-12·9) in those who received identical metformin placebo 
      (hazard ratio [HR] 0·59, 95% CI 0·39-0·89; p=0·012). The metformin beneficial 
      effect was consistent across prespecified subgroups. When metformin was started 
      within 3 days of symptom onset, the HR was 0·37 (95% CI 0·15-0·95). There was no 
      effect on cumulative incidence of long COVID with ivermectin (HR 0·99, 95% CI 
      0·59-1·64) or fluvoxamine (1·36, 0·78-2·34) compared with placebo. 
      INTERPRETATION: Outpatient treatment with metformin reduced long COVID incidence 
      by about 41%, with an absolute reduction of 4·1%, compared with placebo. 
      Metformin has clinical benefits when used as outpatient treatment for COVID-19 
      and is globally available, low-cost, and safe. FUNDING: Parsemus Foundation;

TI  - Oxaloacetate Treatment For Mental And Physical Fatigue In Myalgic 
      Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long-COVID fatigue 
      patients: a non-randomized controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 295

LID - 295
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no approved pharmaceutical intervention for Myalgic 
      Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Fatigue in these patients 
      can last for decades. Long COVID may continue to ME/CFS, and currently, it is 
      estimated that up to 20 million Americans have significant symptoms after COVID, 
      and the most common symptom is fatigue. Anhydrous Enol-Oxaloacetate, (AEO) a 
      nutritional supplement, has been anecdotally reported to relieve physical and 
      mental fatigue and is dimished in ME/CFS patients. Here, we examine the use of 
      higher dosage AEO as a medical food to relieve pathological fatigue. METHODS: 
      ME/CFS and Long-COVID patients were enrolled in an open label dose escalating 
      "Proof of Concept" non-randomized controlled clinical trial with 500 mg AEO 
      capsules. Control was provided by a historical ME/CFS fatigue trial and 
      supporting meta-analysis study, which showed average improvement with oral 
      placebo using the Chalder Scale of 5.9% improvement from baseline. At baseline, 
      73.7% of the ME/CFS patients were women, average age was 47 and length of ME/CFS 
      from diagnosis was 8.9 years. The Long-COVID patients were a random group that 
      responded to social media advertising (Face Book) with symptoms for at least 
      6 months. ME/CFS patients were given separate doses of 500 mg BID (N = 23), 
      1,000 mg BID (N = 29) and 1000 mg TID (N = 24) AEO for six weeks. Long COVID 
      patients were given 500 mg AEO BID (N = 22) and 1000 mg AEO (N = 21), again over 
      a six-week period. The main outcome measure was to compare baseline scoring with 
      results at 6 weeks with the Chalder Fatigue Score (Likert Scoring) versus 
      historical placebo. The hypothesis being tested was formulated prior to data 
      collection. RESULTS: 76 ME/CFS patients (73.7% women, median age of 47) showed an 
      average reduction in fatigue at 6 weeks as measured by the "Chalder Fatigue 
      Questionnaire" of 22.5% to 27.9% from baseline (P < 0.005) (Likert scoring). Both 
      physical and mental fatigue were significantly improved over baseline and 
      historical placebo. Fatigue amelioration in ME/CFS patients increased in a dose 
      dependent manner from 21.7% for 500 mg BID to 27.6% for 1000 mg Oxaloacetate BID 
      to 33.3% for 1000 mg TID. Long COVID patients' fatigue was significantly reduced 
      by up to 46.8% in 6-weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Significant reductions in physical and 
      metal fatigue for ME/CFS and Long-COVID patients were seen after 6 weeks of 
      treatment. As there has been little progress in providing fatigue relief for the 
      millions of ME/CFS and Long COVID patients, anhydrous enol oxaloacetate may 
      bridge this important medical need. Further study of oxaloacetate supplementation 
      for the treatment of ME/CFS and Long COVID is warranted. Trial Registration

      1,000 mg BID Normalized Fatigue Data for Baseline, 2-weeks and 6-weeks evaluated

TI  - Beyond Antivirals: Alternative Therapies for Long COVID.
LID - 10.3390/v16111795 [doi]
LID - 1795
AB  - Long COVID or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) is a condition 
      characterized by numerous lingering symptoms that persist for weeks to months 
      following the viral illness. While treatment for PASC is still evolving, several 
      therapeutic approaches beyond traditional antiviral therapies are being 
      investigated, such as immune-modulating agents, anti-inflammatory drugs, and 
      various supportive interventions focusing at alleviating symptoms and enhancing 
      recovery. We aimed to summarize the breadth of available evidence, identify 
      knowledge gaps, and highlight promising non-antiviral therapies for Long 
      COVID/PASC. We followed the framework of a scoping methodology by mapping 
      existing evidence from a range of studies, including randomized clinical trials, 
      observational research, and case series. Treatments evaluated include metformin, 
      low-dose naltrexone (LDN), dexamethasone, statins, omega-3 fatty acids, 
      L-arginine, and emerging therapies like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and 
      therapeutic apheresis. Early findings suggest that metformin has the strongest 
      clinical evidence, particularly from large phase 3 trials, while LDN and 
      dexamethasone show potential based on observational studies. However, many 
      treatments lack robust, large-scale trials. This review emphasizes the need for 
      further research to confirm the efficacy of these treatments and guide clinical 
      practice for Long COVID management.

AB  - As other European countries, France is experiencing a resurgence of pertussis in 
      2024. Between 1 January and 31 May 2024, 5,616 (24.9%) positive Bordetella 
      pertussis qPCR tests were identified, following a 3-year period of almost null 
      incidence. Of 67 cultured and whole genome sequenced B. pertussis isolates, 66 
      produced pertactin and 56 produced FIM2, in contrast to pre-COVID-19 years. One 
      isolate of genotype Bp-AgST4 was resistant to macrolides. Pertussis resurgence 
      may favour isolates that produce FIM2 and pertactin.

TI  - Vitamins K2 and D3 Improve Long COVID, Fungal Translocation, and Inflammation: 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/nu17020304 [doi]
LID - 304
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long COVID (LC) is characterized by persistent symptoms at least 3 
      months after a SARS-COV-2 infection. LC has been associated with fungal 
      translocation, gut dysfunction, and enhanced systemic inflammation. Currently, 
      there is no approved treatment for this condition. The anti-inflammatory effect 
      of vitamins K2 and D3 was shown to help attenuate the course of acute COVID-19 
      infection. OBJECTIVE AND HYPOTHESIS: This trial aims to investigate the effects 
      of vitamins K2/D3 on LC symptoms, as well as gut and inflammatory markers, in 
      people with established long COVID. Our hypothesis is that by attenuating 
      systemic inflammation, vitamins K2/D3 will improve long COVID symptoms. METHODS: 
      This single-site randomized controlled study enrolled adults experiencing ≥2 
      moderate LC symptoms at least 3 months after a COVID-19 infection. The RECOVER 
      Long COVID Research Index and number and type of LC symptoms were considered. 
      Participants were randomized 2:1 to daily 240 µg K2 (pure MK-7 form) and 2000 UI 
      vitamin D3 or standard of care (SOC) for 24 weeks. The endpoints were changes in 
      symptomatology and in select inflammatory, metabolic, and gut biomarkers at 24 
      weeks. RESULTS: We enrolled 151 participants (n = 98 received vit K2/D3 and 53 
      received SOC). The median age was 46 years; 71% were female and 29% were 
      non-white. Baseline demographics were balanced between groups. At 24 weeks, the 
      active treatment group only had a sharp increase in 25(OH) D, indicating good 
      treatment adherence. In the vitamin K2/D3 arm, there was a 7.1% decrease in the 
      proportion who had an LC Index ≥12 (vs. a 7.2% increase in the SOC group; p = 
      0.01). The average number of LC symptoms remained stable in the vitamin K2/D3 arm 
      but increased in the SOC arm (p = 0.03). Additionally, reductions in oxidized 
      LDL, inflammatory markers sTNF-RI and sCD163, and fungal translocation marker 
      (1,3)-β-d-glucan were observed in the vitamin K2/D3 arm compared to the SOC arm 
      (p < 0.01) over 24 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamins K2/D3 improved the RECOVER Long 
      COVID Index, the number of LC symptoms, and several gut and inflammatory markers. 
      Vitamins K2/D3 provide a promising safe intervention for people suffering from 
      long COVID.

TI  - Low-dose naltrexone for post-COVID fatigue syndrome: a study protocol for a 
      double-blind, randomised trial in British Columbia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A significant proportion of individuals suffering from post 
      COVID-19 condition (PCC, also known as long COVID) can present with persistent, 
      disabling fatigue similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome 
      (ME/CFS) and post-viral fatigue syndromes. There remains no clear pharmacological 
      therapy for patients with this subtype of PCC, which can be referred to as 
      post-COVID fatigue syndrome (PCFS). A low dose of the opioid antagonist 
      naltrexone (ie, low-dose naltrexone (LDN)) has emerged as an off-label treatment 
      for treating fatigue and other symptoms in PCC. However, only small, 
      non-controlled studies have assessed LDN in PCC, so randomised trials are 
      urgently required. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A prospective, randomised, double-blind, 
      parallel arm, placebo-controlled phase II trial will be performed to assess the 
      efficacy of LDN for improving fatigue in PCFS. The trial will be decentralised 
      and open to eligible individuals throughout the Canadian province of British 
      Columbia (BC). Participants will be recruited through the province-wide 
      Post-COVID-19 Interdisciplinary Clinical Care Network (PC-ICCN) and research 
      volunteer platform (REACH BC). Eligible participants will be 19-69 years old, 
      have had a confirmed or physician-suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 3 
      months prior and meet clinical criteria for PCFS adapted from the Institute of 
      Medicine ME/CFS criteria. Individuals who are taking opioid medications, have a 
      history of ME/CFS prior to COVID-19 or history of significant liver disease will 
      be excluded. Participants will be randomised to an LDN intervention arm (n=80) or 
      placebo arm (n=80). Participants in each arm will be prescribed identical 
      capsules starting at 1 mg daily and follow a prespecified schedule for 
      up-titration to 4.5 mg daily or the maximum tolerated dose. The trial will be 
      conducted over 16 weeks, with assessments at baseline, 6, 12 and 16 weeks. The 
      primary outcome will be fatigue severity at 16 weeks evaluated by the Fatigue 
      Severity Scale. Secondary outcomes will include pain Visual Analogue Scale score, 
      overall symptom severity as measured by the Patient Phenotyping Questionnaire 
      Short Form, 7-day step count and health-related quality of life measured by the 
      EuroQol 5-Dimension questionnaire. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has been 
      authorised by Health Canada and approved by The University of British 
      Columbia/Children's and Women's Health Centre of British Columbia Research Ethics 
      Board. On completion, findings will be disseminated to patients, caregivers and 
      clinicians through engagement activities within existing PCC and ME/CFS networks. 
      Results will be published in academic journals and presented at conferences.

      post COVID-19 pandemic: a 6-year study in southern China.

AB  - With the atypical rise of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection (MPI) in 2023, prompt 
      studies are needed to determine the current epidemic features and risk factors 
      with emerging trends of MPI to furnish a framework for subsequent investigations. 
      This multicentre, retrospective study was designed to analyse the epidemic 
      patterns of MPI before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as genotypes and 
      the macrolide-resistance-associated mutations in MP sampled from paediatric 
      patients in Southern China. Clinical data was collected from 1,33,674 patients 
      admitted into investigational hospitals from 1 June 2017 to 30 November 2023. 
      Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) data were retrieved based on MP 
      sequence positive samples from 299 paediatric patients for 
      macrolide-resistance-associated mutations analysis. Pearson's chi-squared test 
      was used to compare categorical variables between different time frames. The 
      monthly average cases of paediatric common respiratory infection diseases 
      increased without enhanced public health measures after the pandemic, especially 
      for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus infection, and MPI. The contribution 
      of MPI to pneumoniae was similar to that in the outbreak in 2019. Compared to 
      mNGS data between 2019-2022 and 2023, the severity of MP did not grow stronger 
      despite higher rates of macrolide-resistance hypervariable sites, including loci 
      2063 and 2064, were detected in childhood MP samples of 2023. Our findings 
      indicated that ongoing surveillance is necessary to understand the impact of post 
      pandemic on MP transmission disruption during epidemic season and the severity of 
      clinical outcomes in different scenarios.

      pertussis. Here, we present a genomic epidemiological investigation of these 
      events. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study using 
      culture-positive B pertussis isolated in Shanghai, China, from 2016 to 2024. We 
      analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome 
      sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic 
      profile, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains 
      with 6450 Chinese and global strains. RESULTS: From pre-COVID-19 (before December 
      2019) to post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 
      397/442) to a higher proportion of infections in older children (infant: 16%, 
      132/844), with the share of vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 
      88% (664/756). The macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis prevalence increased 
      from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a 
      ptxP3-lineage macrolide-resistant clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of 
      causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, 
      was temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological 
      transition. Although MR-MT28 showed increased expression of genes encoding 
      pertussis toxin, it was associated with significantly milder clinical symptoms 
      and a lower hospitalization rate. MR-MT28 likely originated in China around 2016, 
      after acquiring several key mutations, including a novel prn150 allele, and has 
      been detected across multiple regions in China. In addition, 26% (50/195) of 
      MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted Pertactin (PRN)-deficient strains, with an 
      IS481 insertion being the predominant mechanism. DISCUSSION: We report that the 
      post-COVID-19 upsurge of pertussis in China is associated with ptxP3-MR-MT28, and 
      provide evidence that pathogen evolution is likely the primary factor 
      driving + pertussis upsurge, age shift, and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 poses a high 
      risk of global spread and warrants global surveillance.

AB  - Individuals suffering from long-COVID can present with "brain fog", which is 
      characterized by a range of cognitive impairments, such as confusion, short-term 
      memory loss, and difficulty concentrating. To date, several potential 
      interventions for brain fog have been considered. Notably, no systematic review 
      has comprehensively discussed the impact of each intervention type on brain fog 
      symptoms. We included studies on adult (aged > 18 years) individuals with proven 
      long- COVID brain-fog symptoms from PubMed, MEDLINE, Central, Scopus, and Embase. 
      A search limit was set for articles published between 01/2020 and 31/12/2023. We 
      excluded studies lacking an objective assessment of brain fog symptoms and 
      patients with preexisting neurological diseases that affected cognition before 
      COVID-19 infection. This review provided relevant information from 17 studies. 
      The rehabilitation studies utilized diverse approaches, leading to a range of 
      outcomes in terms of the effectiveness of the interventions. Six studies 
      described noninvasive brain stimulation, and all showed improvement in cognitive 
      ability. Three studies described hyperbaric oxygen therapy, all of which showed 
      improvements in cognitive assessment tests and brain perfusion. Two studies 
      showed that the use of Palmitoylethanolamide and Luteolin (PEA-LUT) improved 
      cognitive impairment. Noninvasive brain stimulation and hyperbaric oxygen therapy 
      showed promising results in the treatment of brain fog symptoms caused by 
      long-COVID, with improved perfusion and cortical excitability. Furthermore, both 
      rehabilitation strategies and PEA-LUT administration have been associated with 
      improvements in symptoms of brain fog. Future studies should explore combinations 
      of interventions and include longer follow-up periods to assess the long-term 
      effects of these treatments.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has caused unprecedented global 
      disruption since 2020. Approximately 238 million people are affected worldwide 
      where the elderly succumb to mortality. Post-COVID syndrome and its side effects 
      have popped up with several health hazards, such as macular degeneration and 
      vision loss. It thus necessitates better medical care and management of our 
      dietary practices. Natural flavonoids have been included in traditional medicine 
      and have also been used safely against COVID-19 and several other diseases. 
      Kaempferol is an essential flavonoid that has been demonstrated to influence 
      several vital cellular signaling pathways involved in apoptosis, angiogenesis, 
      inflammation, and autophagy. In this review, we emphasize the plausible 
      regulatory effects of Kaempferol on hallmarks of COVID-19 and macular 
      degeneration.

AB  - Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating 
      disease with a broad overlap of symptomatology with Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS). 
      Despite the severity of symptoms and various neurological, cardiovascular, 
      microvascular, and skeletal muscular findings, no biomarkers have been 
      identified. The Transient receptor potential melastatin 3 (TRPM3) channel, 
      involved in pain transduction, thermosensation, transmitter and neuropeptide 
      release, mechanoregulation, vasorelaxation, and immune defense, shows altered 
      function in ME/CFS. Dysfunction of TRPM3 in natural killer (NK) cells, 
      characterized by reduced calcium flux, has been observed in ME/CFS and PCS 
      patients, suggesting a role in ineffective pathogen clearance and potential virus 
      persistence and autoimmunity development. TRPM3 dysfunction in NK cells can be 
      improved by naltrexone in vitro and ex vivo, which may explain the moderate 
      clinical efficacy of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) treatment. We propose that TRPM3 
      dysfunction may have a broader involvement in ME/CFS pathophysiology, affecting 
      other organs. This paper discusses TRPM3's expression in various organs and its 
      potential impact on ME/CFS symptoms, with a focus on small nerve fibers and the 
      brain, where TRPM3 is involved in presynaptic GABA release.

TI  - Long COVID - a critical disruption of cholinergic neurotransmission?
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1186/s42234-025-00167-8 [doi]
LID - 5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Following the COVID-19 pandemic, there are many chronically ill Long 
      COVID (LC) patients with different symptoms of varying degrees of severity. The 
      pathological pathways of LC remain unclear until recently and make identification 
      of path mechanisms and exploration of therapeutic options an urgent challenge. 
      There is an apparent relationship between LC symptoms and impaired cholinergic 
      neurotransmission. METHODS: This paper reviews the current literature on the 
      effects of blocked nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the main 
      affected organ and cell systems and contrasts this with the unblocking effects of 
      the alkaloid nicotine. In addition, mechanisms are presented that could explain 
      the previously unexplained phenomenon of post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). The 
      fact that not only SARS-CoV-2 but numerous other viruses can bind to nAChRs is 
      discussed under the assumption that numerous other post-viral diseases and 
      autoimmune diseases (ADs) may also be due to impaired cholinergic transmission. 
      We also present a case report that demonstrates changes in cholinergic 
      transmission, specifically, the availability of α4β2 nAChRs by using 
      (-)-[(18)F]Flubatine whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of 
      cholinergic dysfunction in a LC patient along with a significant neurological 
      improvement before and after low-dose transcutaneous nicotine (LDTN) 
      administration. Lastly, a descriptive analysis and evaluation were conducted on 
      the results of a survey involving 231 users of LDTN. RESULTS: A substantial body 
      of research has emerged that offers a compelling explanation for the phenomenon 
      of LC, suggesting that it can be plausibly explained because of impaired nAChR 
      function in the human body. Following a ten-day course of transcutaneous nicotine 
      administration, no enduring neuropathological manifestations were observed in the 
      patient. This observation was accompanied by a significant increase in the number 
      of free ligand binding sites (LBS) of nAChRs, as determined by 
      (-)-[(18)F]Flubatine PET imaging. The analysis of the survey shows that the 
      majority of patients (73.5%) report a significant improvement in the symptoms of 
      their LC/MEF/CFS disease as a result of LDTN. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, based 
      on current knowledge, LDTN appears to be a promising and safe procedure to 
      relieve LC symptoms with no expected long-term harm.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (COVID-19) virus uses 
      Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a gateway for their entry into the 
      human body. The ACE2 with cleaved products have emerged as major contributing 
      factors to multiple physiological functions and pathogenic complications leading 
      to the clinical consequences of the COVID-19 infection Decreased ACE2 expression 
      restricts the viral entry into the human cells and reduces the viral load. 
      COVID-19 infection reduces the ACE2 expression and induces post-COVID-19 
      complications like pneumonia and lung injury. The modulation of the ACE2-Ang 
      (1-7)-Mas (AAM) axis is also being explored as a modality to treat post-COVID-19 
      complications. Evidence indicates that specific food components may modulate the 
      AAM axis. The variations in the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and the 
      post-COVID its complications are being correlated with varied dietary habits. 
      Some of the food substances have emerged to have supportive roles in treating 
      post-COVID-19 complications and are being considered as adjuvants to the COVID-19 
      therapy. It is possible that some of their active ingredients may emerge as the 
      direct treatment for the COVID-19.

AB  - The socio-economic implications of COVID-19 are devastating. Considerable 
      morbidity is attributed to 'long-COVID' - an increasingly recognized complication 
      of infection. Its diverse symptoms are reminiscent of vitamin B(12) deficiency, a 
      condition in which methylation status is compromised. We suggest why SARS-CoV-2 
      infection likely leads to increased methyl-group requirements and other 
      disturbances of one-carbon metabolism. We propose these might explain the varied 
      symptoms of long-COVID. Our suggested mechanismmight also apply to similar 
      conditions such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. The 
      hypothesis is evaluable by detailed determination of vitamin B(12)and folate 
      status, including serum formate as well as homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, 
      and correlation with viral and host RNA methylation and symptomatology. If 
      confirmed, methyl-group support should prove beneficial in such individuals.

TI  - Interventions for Improving Long COVID-19 Symptomatology: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/v14091863 [doi]
LID - 1863
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although the understanding of several aspects of long COVID-19 
      syndrome is increasing, there is limited literature regarding the treatment of 
      these signs and symptoms. The aim of our systematic review was to understand 
      which therapies have proved effective against the symptoms of long COVID-19. 
      METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled or clinical trials in 
      several databases was conducted through 15 May 2022. Specific inclusion criteria 
      included: (1) intervention studies, either randomized controlled (RCTs) or 
      clinical trials; (2) diagnosis of long COVID-19, according to the World Health 
      Organization criteria; (3) presence of long COVID-19 for at least 12 weeks after 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: We initially found 1638 articles to screen. After 
      removing 1602 works based on their title/abstract, we considered 35 full texts, 
      and among them, two intervention studies were finally included. The first RCT 
      focused on the greater improvement of treatment combining olfactory 
      rehabilitation with oral supplementation with Palmitoylethanolamide and Luteolin 
      in patients with olfactory dysfunction after COVID-19. The second study evaluated 
      the positive impact of aromatherapy vs. standard care in adult females affected 
      by fatigue. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review found only two intervention studies 
      focused on patients affected by long COVID-19. More intervention studies are 
      needed to investigate potentially positive interventions for long COVID-19 
      symptoms.

AB  - The beginning of the end or the end of the beginning? After two years mastered by 
      coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, we are now witnessing a turnaround. 
      The reduction of severe cases and deaths from COVID-19 led to increasing 
      importance of a new disease called post-COVID syndrome. The term post-COVID is 
      used to indicate permanency of symptoms in patients who have recovered from 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Immune, 
      antiviral, antimicrobial therapies, as well as ozone therapy have been used to 
      treat COVID-19 disease. Vaccines have then become available and administered 
      worldwide to prevent the insurgence of the disease. However, the pandemic is not 
      over yet at all given the emergence of new omicron variants. New therapeutic 
      strategies are urgently needed. In this view, great interest was found in 
      nutraceutical products, including vitamins (C, D, and E), minerals (zinc), 
      melatonin, probiotics, flavonoids (quercetin), and curcumin. This review 
      summarizes the role of nutraceuticals in the prevention and/or treatment of 
      COVID-19 disease and post-COVID syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is a common consequence of COVID-19 infection 
      and persistent symptoms can have a profound impact on quality of life. At present 
      there is little guidance on how best to treat this condition. A variety of 
      interventions have been suggested to promote recovery, including medication and 
      olfactory training. However, it is uncertain whether any intervention is of 
      benefit. This is an update of the 2021 review with one additional study added.  
      OBJECTIVES: 1) To evaluate the benefits and harms of any intervention versus no 
      treatment for people with persisting olfactory dysfunction due to COVID-19 
      infection.  2) To keep the evidence up-to-date, using a living systematic review 
      approach.  SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the 
      Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid 
      MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional 
      sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the latest search was 
      20 October 2021.   SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials 
      (RCTs) in people with COVID-19 related olfactory disturbance that had persisted 
      for at least four weeks. We included any intervention compared to no treatment or 
      placebo.  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our 
      primary outcomes were the recovery of sense of smell, disease-related quality of 
      life and serious adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were the change in sense of 
      smell, general quality of life, prevalence of parosmia and other adverse effects 
      (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of 
      the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included two studies with 30 
      participants. The studies evaluated the following interventions: systemic 
      corticosteroids plus intranasal corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant and 
      palmitoylethanolamide plus luteolin.  Systemic corticosteroids plus intranasal 
      corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant compared to no intervention We included a 
      single RCT with 18 participants who had anosmia for at least 30 days following 
      COVID-19 infection. Participants received a 15-day course of oral corticosteroids 
      combined with nasal irrigation (consisting of an intranasal 
      corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant solution) or no intervention. 
      Psychophysical testing was used to assess olfactory function at 40 days. This is 
      a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was very 
      low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
      Palmitoylethanolamide plus luteolin compared to no intervention We included a 
      single RCT with 12 participants who had anosmia or hyposmia for at least 90 days 
      following COVID-19 infection. Participants received a 30-day course of 
      palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin or no intervention. Psychophysical testing was 
      used to assess olfactory function at 30 days. This is a single, small study and 
      for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was very low. We are unable to draw 
      meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is 
      very limited evidence available on the efficacy and harms of treatments for 
      persistent olfactory dysfunction following COVID-19 infection. However, we have 
      identified a number of ongoing trials in this area. As this is a living 
      systematic review we will update the data regularly, as new results become 
      available.

TI  - Pirfenidone and post-Covid-19 pulmonary fibrosis: invoked again for realistic 
      goals.
PG  - 2017-2026
LID - 10.1007/s10787-022-01027-6 [doi]
AB  - Pirfenidone (PFN) is an anti-fibrotic drug with significant anti-inflammatory 
      property used for treatment of fibrotic conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF). In the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) era, severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could initially lead to acute lung injury 
      (ALI) and in severe cases may cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 
      which is usually resolved with normal lung function. However, some cases of ALI 
      and ARDS are progressed to the more severe critical stage of pulmonary fibrosis 
      commonly named post-Covid-19 pulmonary fibrosis which needs an urgent address and 
      proper management. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to highlight 
      the potential role of PFN in the management of post-Covid-19 pulmonary fibrosis. 
      The precise mechanism of post-Covid-19 pulmonary fibrosis is related to the 
      activation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1), which activates the 
      release of extracellular proteins, fibroblast proliferation, fibroblast migration 
      and myofibroblast conversion. PFN inhibits accumulation and recruitment of 
      inflammatory cells, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of extracellular matrix 
      in response to TGFβ1 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, PFN 
      suppresses furin (TGFβ1 convertase activator) a protein effector involved in the 
      entry of SARS-CoV-2 and activation of TGFβ1, and thus PFN reduces the 
      pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Besides, PFN modulates signaling pathways such as 
      Wingless/Int (Wnt/β-catenin), Yes-Associated Protein (YAP)/Transcription 
      Co-Activator PDZ Binding Motif (TAZ) and Hippo Signaling Pathways that are 
      involved in the pathogenesis of post-Covid-19 pulmonary fibrosis. In conclusion, 
      the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties of PFN may attenuate 
      post-Covid-19 pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent 
      literature relating to viral, fungal and bacterial infections and their 
      interactions within the sinonasal tract in the past 18 months. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated olfactory dysfunction (OD) is 
      variant dependent. Magnetic resonance imaging studies have found greater 
      olfactory cleft opacification and higher olfactory bulb volume in post-COVID-19 
      OD. Olfactory training remains the mainstay of treatment, while platelet-rich 
      plasma injections and ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin 
      combination oral supplementation have shown early promise.Consensus statements on 
      paranasal sinus fungal balls and acute invasive fungal sinusitis have been 
      released.Studies on the nasal microbiome have reported Staphylococcus and 
      Corynebacterium as the most abundant genera, with higher levels of Staphylococcus 
      and Corynebacterium being found in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and 
      healthy individuals respectively. However, there is conflicting evidence on the 
      significance of biodiversity of the nasal microbiome found in CRS versus healthy 
      patients. SUMMARY: While the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic is behind us, its 
      sequelae continue to pose treatment challenges. Further studies in OD have 
      implications in managing the condition, beyond those afflicted post-COVID-19 
      infection. Similarly, more research is needed in studying the nasal microbiome 
      and its implications in the development and treatment of CRS.

AB  - COVID-19 leads to severe respiratory problems, but also to long-COVID syndrome 
      associated primarily with cognitive dysfunction and fatigue. Long-COVID syndrome 
      symptoms, especially brain fog, are similar to those experienced by patients 
      undertaking or following chemotherapy for cancer (chemofog or chemobrain), as 
      well in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) 
      or mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). The pathogenesis of brain fog in these 
      illnesses is presently unknown but may involve neuroinflammation via mast cells 
      stimulated by pathogenic and stress stimuli to release mediators that activate 
      microglia and lead to inflammation in the hypothalamus. These processes could be 
      mitigated by phytosomal formulation (in olive pomace oil) of the natural 
      flavonoid luteolin.

AB  - Most of the people who suffered from COVID-19 fully recovered, but approximately 
      10-20% of them developed a wide variety of symptoms after they recover from their 
      initial illness. Long COVID can develop at any patient; however, several studies 
      suggest that the development of Long Covid syndrome may be linked to severity of 
      acute illness. Some of the risk factors are hospitalization (with mechanical 
      ventilation), Intensive Care Unit admission, age (over 50 years), gender (female) 
      and comorbidities. Since the precise mechanism of Long COVID has not been 
      clarified, neither the management of Long COVID-19 syndrome has been solved yet. 
      Promising results have been published with vaccines as they effectively reduced 
      the risk of Long COVID; however, other data suggest that vaccination results only 
      partial protection in the post-acute phase of the disease. Recently, the orally 
      effective antiviral agents (Paxlovid, molnupiravir) are preferred for outpatient 
      management, and they highly reduce the progression of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 
      to severe one, and consequently, might reduce the development of Long COVID. 
      Finally, recently, several clinical trials are in progress with either dietary 
      supplements or drugs with different mechanisms of action. Additional information 
      on the precise mechanisms, risk factors of Long COVID may result in successful 
      preventive and therapeutic management of Long Covid 19 syndrome.

TI  - Post-COVID Headache: A Literature Review.
PG  - 835-842
LID - 10.1007/s11916-022-01086-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Post-COVID headache may be unique in presentation and 
      mechanism, often presenting as a new phenotype in patients with a history of a 
      primary headache disorder or resulting in a new headache syndrome in those 
      without history of headache. This review presents a description of the literature 
      published focused on post-COVID headache. Additionally, we discuss potential 
      mechanisms and considerations for treatment of post-COVID headache. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Headache is one of the most common symptoms of COVID. Common 
      characteristics are revealed when reviewing the phenotypes of headaches that have 
      been described in patients with COVID-19, with most headache phenotypes 
      resembling migraine and new persistent daily headache. Post-COVID headaches are 
      often described as moderate to severe, persistent, and treatment refractory. This 
      review highlights the diversity of presentation of headaches that present as a 
      complication of COVID-19. Treatment of post-COVID headache is challenging, 
      especially in the setting of a pandemic where resources are limited. CLINICAL 
      CASE: A 42-year-old woman with a history of episodic migraine without aura 
      presents over video visit with a new headache type. Her typical headaches are 
      predominantly left sided, throbbing in nature, and associated with photophobia 
      and phonophobia. They are fully relieved by oral sumatriptan 2 h after treatment. 
      She describes this new headache as a constant, pulsating, holocephalic pain with 
      no other migrainous features that have been ongoing for 6 weeks. She notes that 
      the headache has been persistent since that time. She has tried over-the-counter 
      acetaminophen and ibuprofen and her typical migraine abortive therapy without 
      relief. She is debilitated and wonders if there is anything that will take the 
      pain away. She shares that she tested positive for COVID-19 about 2 days prior to 
      headache onset and has associated rhinorrhea, anosmia, and ageusia.

AB  - The high incidence of post-covid symptoms in humans confirms the need for 
      effective treatment. Due to long-term complications across several disciplines, 
      special treatment programs emerge for affected patients, emphasizing 
      multidisciplinary care. For these reasons, we decided to look at current 
      knowledge about possible long-term complications of COVID-19 disease and then 
      present the effect of flavonoids, which could help alleviate or eliminate 
      complications in humans after overcoming the COVID-19 infection. Based on 
      articles published from 2003 to 2021, we summarize the flavonoids-based molecular 
      mechanisms associated with the post-COVID-19 syndrome and simultaneously provide 
      a complex view regarding their prophylactic and therapeutic potential. Review 
      clearly sorts out the outcome of post-COVID-19 syndrome according particular body 
      systems. The conclusion is that flavonoids play an important role in prevention 
      of many diseases. We suggest that flavonoids as critical nutritional supplements, 
      are suitable for the alleviation and shortening of the period associated with the 
      post-COVID-19 syndrome. The most promising flavonoid with noteworthy therapeutic 
      and prophylactic effect appears to be quercetin.

TI  - The Role of Interferons in Long Covid Infection.
PG  - 65-76
LID - 10.1089/jir.2022.0193 [doi]
AB  - Although the new generation of vaccines and anti-COVID-19 treatment regimens 
      facilitated the management of acute COVID-19 infections, concerns about 
      post-COVID-19 syndrome or Long Covid are rising. This issue can increase the 
      incidence and morbidity of diseases such as diabetes, and cardiovascular, and 
      lung infections, especially among patients suffering from neurodegenerative 
      disease, cardiac arrhythmias, and ischemia. There are numerous risk factors that 
      cause COVID-19 patients to experience post-COVID-19 syndrome. Three potential 
      causes attributed to this disorder include immune dysregulation, viral 
      persistence, and autoimmunity. Interferons (IFNs) are crucial in all aspects of 
      post-COVID-19 syndrome etiology. In this review, we discuss the critical and 
      double-edged role of IFNs in post-COVID-19 syndrome and how innovative biomedical 
      approaches that target IFNs can reduce the occurrence of Long Covid infection.

AB  - Antibacterial resistance is a renewed public health plague in modern times, and 
      the COVID-19 pandemic has rekindled this problem. Changes in antibiotic 
      prescribing behavior, misinformation, financial hardship, environmental impact, 
      and governance gaps have generally enhanced the misuse and improper access to 
      antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic. These determinants, intersected with 
      antibacterial resistance in the current pandemic, may amplify the potential for a 
      future antibacterial resistance pandemic. The occurrence of infections with 
      multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), difficult-to-treat 
      drug-resistant (DTR), carbapenem-resistant (CR), and pan-drug-resistant (PDR) 
      bacteria is still increasing. The aim of this review is to highlight the state of 
      the art of antibacterial resistance worldwide, focusing on the most important 
      pathogens, namely Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella 
      pneumoniae, and their resistance to the most common antibiotics.

LID - 393
AB  - Long-term neurological complications, persisting in patients who cannot fully 
      recover several months after severe SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, are 
      referred to as neurological sequelae of the long COVID syndrome. Among the 
      numerous clinical post-acute COVID-19 symptoms, neurological and psychiatric 
      manifestations comprise prolonged fatigue, "brain fog", memory deficits, 
      headache, ageusia, anosmia, myalgias, cognitive impairments, anxiety, and 
      depression lasting several months. Considering that neurons are highly vulnerable 
      to inflammatory and oxidative stress damages following the overproduction of 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), neuroinflammation and oxidative stress have been 
      suggested to dominate the pathophysiological mechanisms of the long COVID 
      syndrome. It is emphasized that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress 
      damages are crucial for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. 
      Importantly, antioxidant therapies have the potential to slow down and prevent 
      disease progression. However, many antioxidant compounds display low 
      bioavailability, instability, and transport to targeted tissues, limiting their 
      clinical applications. Various nanocarrier types, e.g., liposomes, cubosomes, 
      solid lipid nanoparticles, micelles, dendrimers, carbon-based nanostructures, 
      nanoceria, and other inorganic nanoparticles, can be employed to enhance 
      antioxidant bioavailability. Here, we highlight the potential of phytochemical 
      antioxidants and other neuroprotective agents (curcumin, quercetin, vitamins C, E 
      and D, melatonin, rosmarinic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and Ginkgo Biloba 
      derivatives) in therapeutic strategies for neuroregeneration. A particular focus 
      is given to the beneficial role of nanoparticle-mediated drug-delivery systems in 
      addressing the challenges of antioxidants for managing and preventing 
      neurological disorders as factors of long COVID sequelae.

AB  - Cardiovascular involvement has been described in acute and recovered COVID-19 
      patients. Here, we present a case of symptomatic pericarditis with persistent 
      symptoms for at least six months after the acute infection and report 66 
      published cases of pericarditis in discharged COVID patients. Patient mean age ± 
      SD was 49.7 ± 13.3 years, ranging from 15 to 75 years and 57.6% were female. A 
      proportion of 89.4% patients reported at least one comorbidity, with autoimmune 
      and allergic disorders, hypertension and dyslipidaemia, as the most frequent. 
      Only 8.3% of patients experienced severe symptoms of acute COVID-19. The time 
      between acute COVID and pericarditis symptoms varied from 14 to 255 days. Chest 
      pain (90.9%), tachycardia (60.0%) and dyspnoea (38.2%) were the most frequent 
      symptoms in post-acute pericarditis. A proportion of 45.5% and 87% of patients 
      had an abnormal electrocardiogram and abnormal transthoracic ultrasound, 
      respectively. Colchicine combined with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
      (NSAID) or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) were prescribed to 39/54 (72%) 
      patients. Of them, 12 were switched to corticosteroid therapy due to non-response 
      to the first-line treatment. Only 6 patients had persisting symptoms and were 
      considered as non-respondent to therapy.Our report highlights that pericarditis 
      should be suspected in COVID-19 patients with persistent chest pain and dyspnoea 
      when pulmonary function is normal. Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
      and colchicine is usually effective but corticosteroids are sometimes required.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies showed that patients 
      with cognitive dysfunction and fatigue after COVID-19 exhibit impaired cortical 
      GABA(B-)ergic activity, as revealed by reduced long-interval intracortical 
      inhibition (LICI). Aim of this study was to test the effects of 
      co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide/luteolin (PEA-LUT), an 
      endocannabinoid-like mediator able to enhance GABA-ergic transmission and to 
      reduce neuroinflammation, on LICI. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients (26 females, 
      mean age 49.9 ± 11.4 years, mean time from infection 296.7 ± 112.3 days) 
      suffering from persistent cognitive difficulties and fatigue after mild COVID-19 
      were randomly assigned to receive either PEA-LUT 700 mg + 70 mg or PLACEBO, 
      administered orally bid for eight weeks. The day before (PRE) and at the end of 
      the treatment (POST), they underwent TMS protocols to assess LICI. We further 
      evaluate short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and long-term potentiation 
      (LTP)-like cortical plasticity. RESULTS: Patients treated with PEA-LUT but not 
      with PLACEBO showed a significant increase of LICI and LTP-like cortical 
      plasticity. SAI remained unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Eight weeks of treatment with 
      PEA-LUT restore GABA(B) activity and cortical plasticity in long Covid patients. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: This study confirms altered physiology of the motor cortex in long 
      COVID-19 syndrome and indicates PEA-LUT as a candidate for the treatment of this 
      post-viral condition.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to limit the 
      clinical progression of COVID-19. However, limited therapeutic options are 
      available for standard-risk patients, including those under age 50 who have 
      received the primary series of COVID-19 vaccination as well as a bivalent 
      booster. AREAS COVERED: Metformin is a widely used, inexpensive antihyperglycemic 
      for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 as well as polycystic ovarian 
      syndrome, with a well-described safety profile. EXPERT OPINION: Although the 
      mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, metformin is known to alter 
      glucose metabolism and is under investigation as an antiviral agent, 
      demonstrating in vitro and in vivo activity against SARS-CoV-2. Recent work 
      suggests metformin may also serve as a therapeutic option for patients with 
      COVID-19 as well as those with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, known 
      more commonly as 'long COVID-19.' This manuscript examines what is known about 
      metformin for the treatment of COVID-19 and explores how this drug may be used in 
      the future to address the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

      Vaccination.
LID - 10.3390/v14102143 [doi]
LID - 2143
AB  - Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak 
      and COVID-19 vaccination, new-onset and relapsed clinical cases of membranous 
      nephropathy (MN) have been reported. However, their clinical characteristics and 
      pathogenesis remained unclear. In this article, we collected five cases of MN 
      associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 37 related to COVID-19 vaccination. Of 
      these five cases, four (4/5, 80%) had acute kidney injury (AKI) at disease onset. 
      Phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) in kidney tissue was negative in three (3/5, 
      60%) patients, and no deposition of virus particles was measured among all 
      patients. Conventional immunosuppressive drugs could induce disease remission. 
      The underlying pathogenesis included the subepithelial deposition of viral 
      antigens and aberrant immune response. New-onset and relapsed MN after COVID-19 
      vaccination generally occurred within two weeks after the second dose of vaccine. 
      Almost 27% of patients (10/37) suffered from AKI. In total, 11 of 14 cases showed 
      positive for PLA2R, and 20 of 26 (76.9%) presented with an elevated serum 
      phospholipase A2 receptor antibody (PLA2R-Ab), in which 8 cases exceeded 50 
      RU/mL. Conventional immunosuppressive medications combined with rituximab were 
      found more beneficial to disease remission for relapsed patients. In contrast, 
      new-onset patients responded to conservative treatment. Overall, most patients 
      (24/37, 64.9%) had a favorable prognosis. Cross immunity and enhanced immune 
      response might contribute to explaining the mechanisms of MN post COVID-19 
      vaccination.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lung injury in severe COVID-19 pneumonia can rapidly evolve to 
      established pulmonary fibrosis, with prognostic implications in the acute phase 
      of the disease and long-lasting impact on the quality of life of COVID-19 
      survivors. This is an emerging medical need, and it has been hypothesized that 
      antifibrotic treatments could have a role in ameliorating the fibrotic process in 
      the lungs of these patients. AREAS COVERED: The safety and efficacy of available 
      antifibrotic drugs (nintedanib and pirfenidone) and novel promising agents are 
      being assessed in several ongoing clinical trials that were performed either in 
      critically ill patients admitted to intensive care, or in discharged patients 
      presenting fibrotic sequalae from COVID-19. Literature search was performed using 
      Medline and Clinicaltrials.org databases (2001-2021). EXPERT OPINION: Despite the 
      strong rationale support the use of antifibrotic therapies in COVID-related 
      fibrosis, there are several uncertainties regarding the timing for their 
      introduction and the real risks/benefits ratio of antifibrotic treatment in the 
      acute and the chronic phases of the disease. The findings of ongoing clinical 
      trials and the long-term observation of longitudinal cohorts will eventually 
      clarify the best management approach for these patients.

TI  - Potential Therapeutic Use of the Rosemary Diterpene Carnosic Acid for Alzheimer's 
      Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Long-COVID through NRF2 Activation to 
      Counteract the NLRP3 Inflammasome.
LID - 10.3390/antiox11010124 [doi]
LID - 124
AB  - Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis [family Lamiaceae]), an herb of economic and 
      gustatory repute, is employed in traditional medicines in many countries. 
      Rosemary contains carnosic acid (CA) and carnosol (CS), abietane-type phenolic 
      diterpenes, which account for most of its biological and pharmacological actions, 
      although claims have also been made for contributions of another constituent, 
      rosmarinic acid. This review focuses on the potential applications of CA and CS 
      for Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19), in part via inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. CA exerts 
      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects via phase 2 enzyme 
      induction initiated by activation of the KEAP1/NRF2 transcriptional pathway, 
      which in turn attenuates NLRP3 activation. In addition, we propose that 
      CA-related compounds may serve as therapeutics against the brain-related 
      after-effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed "long-COVID." One factor that 
      contributes to COVID-19 is cytokine storm emanating from macrophages as a result 
      of unregulated inflammation in and around lung epithelial and endovascular cells. 
      Additionally, neurological aftereffects such as anxiety and "brain fog" are 
      becoming a major issue for both the pandemic and post-pandemic period. Many 
      reports hold that unregulated NLRP3 inflammasome activation may potentially 
      contribute to the severity of COVID-19 and its aftermath. It is therefore 
      possible that suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activity may prove efficacious 
      against both acute lung disease and chronic neurological after-effects. Because 
      CA has been shown to not only act systemically but also to penetrate the 
      blood-brain barrier and reach the brain parenchyma to exert neuroprotective 
      effects, we discuss the evidence that CA or rosemary extracts containing CA may 
      represent an effective countermeasure against both acute and chronic pathological 
      events initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as other chronic 
      neurodegenerative diseases including AD and PD.

TI  - Treatment with the senolytics dasatinib/quercetin reduces SARS-CoV-2-related 
      mortality in mice.
PG  - e13771

AB  - The enormous societal impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been 
      particularly harsh for some social groups, such as the elderly. Recently, it has 
      been suggested that senescent cells could play a central role in pathogenesis by 
      exacerbating the pro-inflammatory immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, 
      the selective clearance of senescent cells by senolytic drugs may be useful as a 
      therapy to ameliorate the symptoms of COVID-19 in some cases. Using the 
      established COVID-19 murine model K18-hACE2, we demonstrated that a combination 
      of the senolytics dasatinib and quercetin (D/Q) significantly reduced 
      SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, delayed its onset, and reduced the number of other 
      clinical symptoms. The increase in senescent markers that we detected in the 
      lungs in response to SARS-CoV-2 may be related to the post-COVID-19 sequelae 
      described to date. These results place senescent cells as central targets for the 
      treatment of COVID-19, and make D/Q a new and promising therapeutic tool.

PG  - 2538-2552
LID - 10.1038/s41564-024-01802-x [doi]
AB  - Joint pain and osteoarthritis can occur as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      sequelae after infection. However, little is known about the damage to articular 
      cartilage. Here we illustrate knee joint damage after wild-type, Delta and 
      Omicron variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infection in vivo. Rapid joint injury with cystic lesions at the osteochondral 
      junction was observed in two patients with post-COVID osteoarthritis and 
      recapitulated in a golden Syrian hamster model. SARS-CoV-2-activated endothelin-1 
      signalling increased vascular permeability and caused viral spike proteins 
      leakage into the subchondral bone. Osteoclast activation, chondrocyte dropout and 
      cyst formation were confirmed histologically. The US Food and Drug 
      Administration-approved endothelin receptor antagonist, macitentan, mitigated 
      cystic lesions and preserved chondrocyte number in the acute phase of viral 
      infection in hamsters. Delayed macitentan treatment at post-acute infection phase 
      alleviated chondrocyte senescence and restored subchondral bone loss. It is worth 
      noting that it could also attenuate viral spike-induced joint pain. Our work 
      suggests endothelin receptor blockade as a novel therapeutic strategy for 
      post-COVID arthritis.

TI  - Common Selfcare Indications of Pain Medications in Children.
PG  - 321-341
LID - 10.1007/s40272-023-00562-1 [doi]
AB  - Pain has a multifaceted impact on individuals worldwide, affecting their physical 
      functioning, emotional well-being, and quality of life. Children (age < 18 years) 
      have a high prevalence of conditions associated with pain, such as toothache, 
      headache, earache, sore throat, and respiratory tract infections, many of which 
      may be accompanied by fever. Globally, the pharmacologic treatment of pain in 
      pediatric patients is limited largely to nonopioid analgesics, and dosing must 
      account for differences in age, weight, metabolism, and risk of adverse effects. 
      This narrative review summarizes the findings of a literature search on the 
      pediatric indications, dosing approaches, dosing guidelines, and pharmacokinetics 
      of paracetamol and ibuprofen, which are common pain medications available 
      globally for self-care use in children. The review also discusses the risks and 
      benefits associated with these agents. The current roles of paracetamol and 
      ibuprofen in the symptomatic management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      infection and in the management of post-COVID-19 immunization symptoms in 
      children are also discussed. Therefore, while a very large amount of data over 
      several decades is available for paracetamol and ibuprofen, an urgent need exists 
      for well-designed studies of these medications for the management of pain and 
      fever in pediatric patients with COVID-19 to ensure optimal relief with minimal 
      toxicity.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has 
      relentlessly spread all over the world even after the advent of vaccines. It 
      demands management, treatment, and prevention as well with utmost safety and 
      effectiveness. It is well researched that herbal medicines or natural products 
      have shown promising outcomes to strengthen immunity with antiviral potential 
      against SARS-COV-2. AIM OF THE REVIEW: Our objective is to provide a 
      comprehensive insight into the preventive and therapeutic effects of herbal 
      medicines and products (Ayurvedic) for pre-and post-COVID manifestations. 
      MATERIAL AND METHOD: The database used in the text is collected and compiled from 
      Scopus, PubMed, Nature, Elsevier, Web of Science, bioRxiv, medRxiv, American 
      Chemical Society, and clinicaltrials.gov up to January 2022. Articles from 
      non-academic sources such as websites and news were also retrieved. Exploration 
      of the studies was executed to recognize supplementary publications of research 
      studies and systematic reviews. The keywords, such as "SARS-COV-2, coronavirus, 
      COVID-19, herbal drugs, immunity, herbal immunomodulators, infection, herbal 
      antiviral drugs, and WHO recommendation" were thoroughly searched. Chemical 
      structures were drawn using the software Chemdraw Professional 15.0.0.160 
      (PerkinElmer Informatics, Inc.). RESULT: A plethora of literature supports that 
      the use of herbal regimens not only strengthen immunity but can also treat 
      SARS-COV-2 infection with minimal side effects. This review summarizes the 
      mechanistic insights into herbal therapy engaging interferons and antibodies to 
      boost the response against SARS-COV-2 infection, several clinical trials, and in 
      silico studies (computational approaches) on selected natural products including, 
      Ashwagandha, Guduchi, Yashtimadhu, Tulsi, etc. as preventive and therapeutic 
      measures against COVID. We have also emphasized the exploitation of herbal 
      medicine-based pharmaceutical products along with perspectives for unseen 
      upcoming alike diseases. CONCLUSION: According to the current state of art and 
      cutting-edge research on herbal medicines have showed a significant promise as 
      modern COVID tools. Since vaccination cannot be purported as a long-term cure for 
      viral infections, herbal/natural medicines can only be considered a viable 
      alternative to current remedies, as conceived from our collected data to unroot 
      recurring viral infections.

TI  - Possible Application of Melatonin in Long COVID.
LID - 10.3390/biom12111646 [doi]
LID - 1646
AB  - Clinical sequelae and symptoms for a considerable number of COVID-19 patients can 
      linger for months beyond the acute stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, "long COVID". 
      Among the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, cognitive issues 
      (especially memory loss or "brain fog"), chronic fatigue, myalgia, and muscular 
      weakness resembling myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) 
      are of importance. Melatonin may be particularly effective at reducing the signs 
      and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its functions as an antioxidant, 
      anti-inflammatory, and immuno-modulatory agent. Melatonin is also a chronobiotic 
      medication effective in treating delirium and restoring the circadian imbalance 
      seen in COVID patients in the intensive care unit. Additionally, as a 
      cytoprotector, melatonin aids in the prevention of several COVID-19 
      comorbidities, including diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and ischemic and 
      non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases. This narrative review discusses the 
      application of melatonin as a neuroprotective agent to control cognitive 
      deterioration ("brain fog") and pain in the ME/CFS syndrome-like documented in 
      long COVID. Further studies on the therapeutic use of melatonin in the 
      neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection are warranted.

TI  - Efficacy of Palmitoylethanolamide and Luteolin Association on Post-Covid 
      Olfactory Dysfunction: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Studies.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines11082189 [doi]
LID - 2189
AB  - Post-Covid Olfactory Dysfunction (PCOD) is characterized by olfactory 
      abnormalities, hyposmia, and anosmia, which are among the most often enduring 
      symptoms in individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This 
      disorder has been reported to persist in subsets of patients well after 12 months 
      following infection, significantly affecting their quality of life. Despite the 
      high prevalence of PCOD among patients who suffered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      specific therapeutic strategies are still limited. Among these, emerging evidence 
      seems to indicate the administration of CoUltraPEALut, a combination of 
      micronized Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous fatty acid amide, and 
      Luteolin, a natural antioxidant flavonoid, as a viable therapy, especially when 
      given as an adjuvant to olfactory training. Based on the above, a systematic 
      review and a meta-analysis of the literature were conducted, with the aim of 
      evaluating the efficacy of CoUltraPEALut as an addition to olfactory training 
      (OT), in treating PCOD symptoms. Pubmed (MEDLINE), Embase (OVID), and Web of 
      Science scientific databases were screened from the inception until 31 May 2023, 
      and a total of 407 articles were recovered; only five of these studies (441 total 
      patients between treated and control groups) were included in the systematic 
      review. CoUltraPEALut demonstrated significant efficacy in the overall recovery 
      of the olfactory function, compared to the conventional therapy, suggesting that 
      it could represent a possible future adjuvant treatment for PCOD.

AB  - The medium- to long-term consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known, though an 
      increase in mental health problems are predicted. Multidisciplinary strategies 
      across socio-economic and psychological levels may be needed to mitigate the 
      mental health burden of COVID-19. Preliminary evidence from the rapidly 
      progressing field of psychedelic science shows that psilocybin therapy offers a 
      promising transdiagnostic treatment strategy for a range of disorders with 
      restricted and maladaptive habitual patterns of cognition and behaviour, notably 
      depression, addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder. The COMPASS Pathways 
      (COMPASS) phase 2b double-blind trial of psilocybin therapy in 
      antidepressant-free, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is underway to 
      determine the safety, efficacy and optimal dose of psilocybin. Results from the 
      Imperial College London Psilodep-RCT comparing the efficacy and mechanisms of 
      action of psilocybin therapy to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) 
      escitalopram will soon be published. However, the efficacy and safety of 
      psilocybin therapy in conjunction with SSRIs in TRD is not yet known. An 
      additional COMPASS study, with a centre in Dublin, will begin to address this 
      question, with potential implications for the future delivery of psilocybin 
      therapy. While at a relatively early stage of clinical development, and 
      notwithstanding the immense challenges of COVID-19, psilocybin therapy has the 
      potential to play an important therapeutic role for various psychiatric disorders 
      in post-COVID-19 clinical psychiatry.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant global impact, resulting in 
      long-term health effects for many individuals. As more patients recover, there is 
      a growing need to identify effective management strategies for ongoing health 
      concerns, such as post-COVID-19 syndrome, characterized by persistent symptoms or 
      complications beyond several weeks or months from the onset of symptoms. In this 
      review, we explore the potential of dietary polysaccharides as a promising 
      approach to managing post-COVID-19 syndrome. We summarize the immunomodulatory, 
      antioxidant, antiviral, and prebiotic activities of dietary polysaccharides for 
      the management of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Furthermore, the review investigates 
      the role of polysaccharides in enhancing immune response, regulating immune 
      function, improving oxidative stress, inhibiting virus binding to ACE2, balancing 
      gut microbiota, and increasing functional metabolites. These properties of 
      dietary polysaccharides may help alleviate COVID-19 symptoms, providing a 
      promising avenue for effective treatment strategies.

AB  - In this review it is attempted to summarize current studies about formation of 
      eicosanoids and other oxylipins in different human macrophages. There are several 
      reports on M1 and M2 cells, also other phenotypes have been described. The 
      eicosanoids formed in the largest amounts are the COX products TxB(2) and PGE(2). 
      Thus shortlived bioactive TxA(2) is a dominating product both in M1- and in 
      M2-lineages, one exception seems to be M(GM-CSF, TGFβ) cells. 5-LOX products are 
      produced in both M1 and M2 macrophages, as well as in not fully polarized cells 
      of both lineages. M(M-CSF) as well as M2 macrophages produced LTC(4) more readily 
      compared to M1 lineage cells. In M(GM-CSF, TGFβ) cells LTB(4) is a major 
      eicosanoid, in line with high expression of LTA(4) hydrolase. Recent reports 
      described increased formation of leukotrienes in macrophages subjected to trained 
      immunity with inflammatory transcriptional reprogramming. Also in macrophages 
      derived from monocytes collected from post-COVID-19 patients. 15-LOX-1 is 
      strongly upregulated in CD206(+) M2 cells (M2a), differentiated in presence of 
      IL-4. These macrophages also express 15-LOX-2. In incubations with pathogenic E. 
      coli as well as other stimuli 15(S)-HETE and 17(S)-HDHA were major oxylipins 
      formed. Also, the SPM precursor 5,15-diHETE and the SPM RvD5 were produced in 
      considerable amounts, while other SPMs were less abundant. In M2 macrophages 
      incubated with E. coli or S. aureus the cytosolic 15-LOX-1 enzyme accumulated to 
      punctuate structures in a Ca(2+) dependent manner with a relatively slow time 
      course, leading to formation of mediators from endogenous substrate. Chalcones, 
      flavone-like anti-inflammatory natural products, induced translocation of 
      15-LOX-1 in M2 cells, with high formation of 15-LOX derived oxylipins.

TI  - Beyond "Psychotropic": Repurposing Psychiatric Drugs for COVID-19, Alzheimer's 
      Disease, and Cancer.
LID - 22r14494 [pii]
LID - 10.4088/JCP.22r14494 [doi]
AB  - Importance: "Psychotropic" drugs have widespread reach and impact throughout the 
      brain and body. Thus, many of these drugs could be repurposed for non-psychiatric 
      indications of high public health impact. Observations: The selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluvoxamine was shown efficacious as a COVID-19 
      treatment based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and a benefit of other 
      antidepressants has been posited based on observational and preclinical studies. 
      In this review, we illuminate features of SSRIs and other psychiatric drugs that 
      make them candidates to repurpose for non-psychiatric indications. We summarize 
      research that led to fluvoxamine's use in COVID-19 and provide guidance on how to 
      use it safely. We summarize studies suggestive of benefit of other 
      antidepressants versus COVID-19 and long COVID. We also describe putative 
      mechanisms of psychiatric drugs in treating long COVID, Alzheimer's disease, 
      cancer, and other conditions. Conclusion and Relevance: There is a potentially 
      great clinical and public health impact of psychotropic drug repurposing. 
      Challenges exist to such repurposing efforts, but solutions exist for 
      researchers, regulators, and funders that overcome these challenges.

TI  - Amitriptyline for post-COVID headache: effectiveness, tolerability, and response

PG  - 5702-5709
LID - 10.1007/s00415-022-11225-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Headache is one of the most frequently reported symptoms in 
      post-COVID patients. The clinical phenotype of COVID-19 headache combines 
      phenotypic features of both tension-type headache (TTH) and migraine. We aimed to 
      assess the effectiveness, side effects and predictors of amitriptyline (AMT) 
      response in a real-world study setting. METHODS: We performed an observational 
      multicentric study with a retrospective cohort. All consecutive patients with 
      confirmed COVID-19 infection who received AMT for post-COVID headache from March 
      2020 to May 2021 were included. Response was evaluated by the reduction in the 
      number of headache days per month (HDM) between weeks 8 and 12, compared with the 
      baseline. We explored which variables were associated with a higher probability 
      of response to AMT. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were eligible for the study, 
      40/48 (83.3%) females, aged 46.85 (SD: 13.59) years. Patients had history of 
      migraine 15/48 (31.3%) or TTH 5/48 (10.4%). The mean reduction of HDM was 9.6 
      (SD: 10.9; 95% CI 6.5, 12.7) days. Only 2/48 (5%) of patients discontinued AMT 
      due to poor tolerability. History of TTH (10.9, 95% CI 1.3, 20.6) and nausea 
      (- 8.5, 95% CI - 14.6, - 2.5) were associated with AMT response. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study provides real-world evidence of the potential benefit of AMT in 
      patients with post-COVID-19 headache, especially in patients with history of TTH 
      and without concomitant nausea.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), characterised by high levels of inflammation 
      and oxidative stress (OS). Oxidative stress induces oxidative damage to lipids, 
      proteins, and DNA, causing tissue damage. Both inflammation and OS contribute to 
      multi-organ failure in severe cases. Magnesium (Mg(2+) ) regulates many 
      processes, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses, as well as the 
      proper functioning of other micronutrients such as vitamin D. In addition, Mg(2+) 
      participates as a second signalling messenger in the activation of T cells. 
      Therefore, Mg(2+) deficiency can cause immunodeficiency, exaggerated acute 
      inflammatory response, decreased antioxidant response, and OS. Supplementation 
      with Mg(2+) has an anti-inflammatory response by reducing the levels of nuclear 
      factor kappa B (NF-κB), interleukin (IL) -6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. 
      Furthermore, Mg(2+) supplementation improves mitochondrial function and increases 
      the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) content, reducing OS. Therefore, Mg(2+) 
      supplementation is a potential way to reduce inflammation and OS, strengthening 
      the immune system to manage COVID-19. This narrative review will address Mg(2+) 
      deficiency associated with a worse disease prognosis, Mg(2+) supplementation as a 
      potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapy during and after COVID-19 
      disease, and suggest that randomised controlled trials are indicated.

PG  - 539-546

AB  - Background: Methadone and buprenorphine are effective medications for opioid use 
      disorder (MOUD) that are highly regulated in the United States. The on-going 
      opioid crisis, and more recently COVID-19, has prompted reconsideration of these 
      restrictions in order to sustain and improve treatment access, with renewed 
      interest in telemedicine. We reviewed the evidence on use of telemedicine 
      interventions and applicability to MOUD policy changes in the post-COVID-19 
      treatment landscape. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of 
      Systematic Reviews databases were searched from inception to April 2021 and 
      reference lists were reviewed to identify additional studies. Studies were 
      eligible if they examined telemedicine interventions and reported outcomes (e.g. 
      treatment initiation, retention in care). Randomized trials and controlled 
      observational studies were prioritized; other studies were included when stronger 
      evidence was unavailable. One investigator abstracted key information and a 
      second investigator verified data. We described the results qualitatively. 
      Results: We identified nine studies: three controlled trials (two randomized), 
      and six observational studies. Three studies evaluated patients treated with 
      methadone and six studies with buprenorphine, including one study of pregnant 
      women with OUD. All studies showed telemedicine approaches associated with 
      similar outcomes (treatment retention, positive urine toxicology) compared to 
      treatment as usual. Trials were limited by small samples sizes, lack of reporting 
      harms, and most were conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; observational 
      studies were limited by failure to control for confounding. Conclusions: Limited 
      evidence suggests that telemedicine may enhance access to MOUD with similar 
      effectiveness compared with face-to-face treatment. Few studies have been 
      published since COVID-19, and it is unclear the potential impact of these 
      interventions on the existing racial/ethnic disparities in treatment. The 
      COVID-19 pandemic and need for social distancing led to temporary policy changes 
      for prescribing of MOUD that could inform additional research in this area to 
      support comprehensive policy reforms.

TI  - Scientific rationale for the use of α2A-adrenoceptor agonists in treating 
      neuroinflammatory cognitive disorders.
PG  - 4540-4552
LID - 10.1038/s41380-023-02057-4 [doi]
AB  - Neuroinflammatory disorders preferentially impair the higher cognitive and 
      executive functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This includes such 
      challenging disorders as delirium, perioperative neurocognitive disorder, and the 
      sustained cognitive deficits from "long-COVID" or traumatic brain injury. There 
      are no FDA-approved treatments for these symptoms; thus, understanding their 
      etiology is important for generating therapeutic strategies. The current review 
      describes the molecular rationale for why PFC circuits are especially vulnerable 
      to inflammation, and how α2A-adrenoceptor (α2A-AR) actions throughout the nervous 
      and immune systems can benefit the circuits in PFC needed for higher cognition. 
      The layer III circuits in the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) that generate and sustain 
      the mental representations needed for higher cognition have unusual 
      neurotransmission and neuromodulation. They are wholly dependent on NMDAR 
      neurotransmission, with little AMPAR contribution, and thus are especially 
      vulnerable to kynurenic acid inflammatory signaling which blocks NMDAR. Layer III 
      dlPFC spines also have unusual neuromodulation, with cAMP magnification of 
      calcium signaling in spines, which opens nearby potassium channels to rapidly 
      weaken connectivity and reduce neuronal firing. This process must be tightly 
      regulated, e.g. by mGluR3 or α2A-AR on spines, to prevent loss of firing. 
      However, the production of GCPII inflammatory signaling reduces mGluR3 actions 
      and markedly diminishes dlPFC network firing. Both basic and clinical studies 
      show that α2A-AR agonists such as guanfacine can restore dlPFC network firing and 
      cognitive function, through direct actions in the dlPFC, but also by reducing the 
      activity of stress-related circuits, e.g. in the locus coeruleus and amygdala, 
      and by having anti-inflammatory actions in the immune system. This information is 
      particularly timely, as guanfacine is currently the focus of large clinical 
      trials for the treatment of delirium, and in open label studies for the treatment 
      of cognitive deficits from long-COVID.

PG  - 199-207
LID - 10.47665/tb.40.2.012 [doi]
AB  - Post-COVID-19 conditions encompass a wide range of health problems, including 
      enteritis, but their association with parasitic infections has not yet been 
      investigated. This study analyzed gastrointestinal symptoms, medical histories, 
      fecal Cryptosporidium oocysts, and the history of COVID-19 infection in patients 
      who attended the Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, from January to July 
      2021. Fecal biomarkers, including H. pylori, occult blood, fecal calprotectin 
      (FCAL), and TNF-a, were measured, and Cryptosporidium spp. genotypes were 
      molecularly characterized among post-COVID-19 patients using RFLP. Preliminary 
      results from 210 post-COVID-19 patients revealed that group 1 
      (Cryptosporidiumpositive) (n = 49) and group 2 (Cryptosporidium-negative) (n = 
      161) showed no significant difference in the prevalence rate of diabetes mellitus 
      (DM). While group 2 was linked to diarrhea, only infections with Cryptosporidium 
      post-COVID-19 were related to chronic diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss. A 
      total of 220 healthy subjects served as negative controls. Administering 
      azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin was significantly related to an 
      increased risk of Cryptosporidium infection in group 1, whereas only azithromycin 
      was more frequently recorded in group 2. Antioxidant supplementation 
      insignificantly affected the incidence of cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidiosis 
      with a history of COVID-19 was linked to H. pylori infections, increased 
      inflammatory biomarkers (FCAL and TNF-a), and occult blood when compared with 
      group 2. Cryptosporidium genotype 1 was the most commonly occurring subset in 
      individuals with post-COVID-19. The findings demonstrated that aggravating 
      gastrointestinal manifestations, increased fecal biomarkers and anti-COVID-19 
      therapeutic interventions are significantly related to the existence of 
      Cryptosporidium oocysts in patients with post-COVID-19, indicating the 
      predominance of.

TI  - Effect of Ultra-Micronized Palmitoylethanolamide and Luteolin on Olfaction and 
      Memory in Patients with Long COVID: Results of a Longitudinal Study.
LID - 10.3390/cells11162552 [doi]
LID - 2552
AB  - In this study, we investigated whether treatment with palmitoylethanolamide and 
      luteolin (PEA-LUT) leads to improvement in the quantitative or qualitative 
      measures of olfactory dysfunction or relief from mental clouding in patients 
      affected by long COVID. Patients with long COVID olfactory dysfunction were 
      allocated to different groups based on the presence ("previously treated") or 
      absence ("naïve") of prior exposure to olfactory training. Patients were then 
      randomized to receive PEA-LUT alone or in combination with olfactory training. 
      Olfactory function and memory were assessed at monthly intervals using 
      self-report measures and quantitative thresholds. A total of 69 patients (43 
      women, 26 men) with an age average of 40.6 + 10.5 were recruited. PEA-LUT therapy 
      was associated with a significant improvement in validated odor identification 
      scores at the baseline versus each subsequent month; assessment at 3 months 
      showed an average improvement of 10.7 + 2.6, CI 95%: 6-14 (p < 0.0001). The 
      overall prevalence of parosmia was 79.7% (55 patients), with a significant 
      improvement from the baseline to 3 months (p < 0.0001), namely in 31 patients 
      from the Naïve 1 group (72%), 15 from the Naïve 2 group (93.7%), and 9 from the 
      remaining group (90%). Overall, mental clouding was detected in 37.7% (26 
      subjects) of the cases, with a reduction in severity from the baseline to three 
      months (p = 0.02), namely in 15 patients from the Naïve 1 group (34.8%), 7 from 
      the Naïve 2 group (43.7%), and 4 from the remaining group (40%). Conclusions. In 
      patients with long COVID and chronic olfactory loss, a regimen including oral 
      PEA-LUT and olfactory training ameliorated olfactory dysfunction and memory. 
      Further investigations are necessary to discern biomarkers, mechanisms, and 
      long-term outcomes.

TI  - Post-COVID-19 rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis-A clinico-mycological study from 
      North India.

AB  - The second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), during the early 2021, 
      lead to a devastating outbreak of mucormycosis in India. This study aimed to 
      determine the aetiology, clinical features, comorbidities, and risk factors of 
      rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) and antifungal susceptibility pattern 
      for the isolates. The study included all suspected cases of ROCM in post-COVID-19 
      patients attending the hospital from May to December 2021. A total of 70 patients 
      were diagnosed with mucormycosis during the study period. The commonest 
      presentations were rhino-orbital and rhino-orbito-cerebral in 35.7% of cases 
      each. Diabetes mellitus was the commonest associated risk factor in 95.7% of all 
      patients, while 78.5% of the patients were treated with corticosteroids in the 
      recent past, and 25.7% presented with active COVID-19 pneumonia. The commonest 
      isolate was Rhizopus arrhizus n = 14, followed by Aspergillus flavus n = 16, A. 
      fumigatus n = 4, A. niger n = 3, Fusarium oxysporumn = 1, and Apophysomyces 
      variabilisn = 1. Fungal species identification was done by phenotypic methods for 
      all the isolates and DNA sequence analysis of 18 isolates, and antifungal 
      susceptibility testing of 30 isolates was performed by commercially prepared 
      HiMIC plate (HiMedia, Mumbai, India) using broth microdilution for amphotericin 
      B, isavuconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole. The MIC50 and 
      MIC90 of amphotericin B for R. arrhizus strains were 0.25 and 4 μg/ml, 
      respectively; and the MIC50 and MIC90 results for itraconazole, posaconazole, and 
      isavuconazole were 8 and 8, 2 and 2, and 2 and 8 μg/ml, respectively. In vitro 
      data showed that amphotericin B was the most effective antifungal against most 
      species. The commercially available ready-to-use minimum inhibitory concentration 
      plates are user-friendly for performing antifungal susceptibility, which may be 
      useful in choosing appropriate regimens and monitoring emerging resistance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: On 31 July 2023, the United States Department of Health and Human 
      Services announced the formation of the Office of Long COVID Research and 
      Practice and the United States National Institutes of Health opened enrollment 
      for RECOVER-Vital, a randomized study to evaluate new treatment options for long 
      Coronavirus (long COVID). AREAS COVERED: The RECOVER Initiative is a $1.15 
      billion research platform intended to describe, categorize, treat, and prevent 
      long-term symptoms following infection by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus that causes Coronavirus (COVID-19). More 
      than 200 symptoms have been associated with long COVID, potentially affecting 
      nearly all body systems, and current estimates suggest that between 7 million and 
      23 million Americans have developed long COVID. However, there are no approved 
      treatments for this condition. EXPERT OPINION: The first prospective, randomized 
      study of the RECOVER research initiative, RECOVER-Vital, will evaluate the 
      SARS-CoV-2 antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) as a potential treatment 
      for long COVID. This manuscript explores what is known about Paxlovid to treat 
      and prevent long COVID and examines the rationale for addressing this condition 
      with an antiviral agent.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel human 
      coronavirus, which has triggered a global pandemic of the coronavirus infectious 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19). Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases continue to 
      challenge human health worldwide. The virus conquers human cells through the 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor-driven pathway by mostly targeting the 
      human respiratory tract. Quercetin is a natural flavonoid widely represented in 
      the plant kingdom. Cumulative evidence has demonstrated that quercetin and its 
      derivatives have various pharmacological properties including anti-cancer, 
      anti-hypertension, anti-hyperlipidemia, anti-hyperglycemia, anti-microbial, 
      antiviral, neuroprotective, and cardio-protective effects, because it is a 
      potential treatment for severe inflammation and acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome. Furthermore, it is the main life-threatening condition in patients with 
      COVID-19. This article provides a comprehensive review of the primary literature 
      on the predictable effectiveness of quercetin and its derivatives docked to 
      multi-target of SARS-CoV-2 and host cells via in silico and some of validation 
      through in vitro, in vivo, and clinically to fight SARS-CoV-2 infections, 
      contribute to the reduction of inflammation, which suggests the preventive and 
      therapeutic latency of quercetin and its derived-products against COVID-19 
      pandemic, multisystem inflammatory syndromes (MIS), and long-COVID.

TI  - Resveratrol and Gut Microbiota Synergy: Preventive and Therapeutic Effects.
LID - 10.3390/ijms242417573 [doi]
LID - 17573
AB  - The role of an imbalanced high-fat diet in the pathophysiology of common chronic 
      noncommunicable diseases has been known for years. More recently, the concept of 
      'gut microbiota' and the interaction between their composition and gut 
      metabolites produced from the intake of dietary products have gained the focus of 
      researchers, mostly from the perspective of the prevention of cardiovascular and 
      metabolic disorders, which are still the leading cause of death globally. The aim 
      of this work is to highlight the health benefits of the interaction between 
      resveratrol (RSV), red grape polyphenol, and gut microbiota, through aspects of 
      their therapeutic and preventive potentials. Since changed microbiota (mostly as 
      a consequence of antibiotic overuse) contribute to the persistence of post 
      ('long')-COVID-19 symptoms, these aspects will be covered too. Data were obtained 
      from the electronic databases (MedLine/PubMed), according to specific keywords 
      regarding the protective role of resveratrol, the gut microbiota, and their 
      synergy. RSV exerts beneficial properties in the modulation of cardiovascular, 
      metabolic, and post-COVID-19-related disorders. In healthy individuals, it 
      maintains an ergogenic capacity, prevents oxidative stress, and modulates the 
      inflammatory response. Overall, it improves quality of life. The 
      RSV-gut-microbiota interaction is beneficial in terms of maintaining human 
      health. Along with physical activity, it is key for the prevention of chronic 
      noncommunicable diseases.

TI  - Pharmacogenetic Aspects of COVID-19 Management and Post-COVID-19 Depression 
      Treatment with Fluvoxamine.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quarantine measures with self-isolation of varying duration have been 
      significant psychosocial stressors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
      serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine has been considered as a 
      prophylaxis against depression in early COVID-19 patients, with additional 
      benefits apparently arising from its antiviral activity. In this narrative 
      review, we draw attention to the body of evidence showing efficacy of fluvoxamine 
      in protecting against depressive disorders in COVID-19 patients, while also 
      attenuating the severity of COVID-19 disease, with a notable reduction in the 
      need for intubation and lower mortality. We consider this potential two-fold 
      action of fluvoxamine in the light of its pharmacogenetic and pharmacological 
      profiles. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Full-text publications in English and Russian in 
      Google Scholar, PubMed, NCBI, Web of Science, and E-Library databases were 
      selected by keywords, solitary and in combination (fluvoxamine, COVID-19, 
      depression, anxiety, antidepressants, adverse reactions) for the period from 
      March 01, 2020 to June 06, 2022. We also analyzed the full-text publications in 
      English and Russian language reporting adverse reactions caused by fluvoxamine 
      use for the period from 2012 to 2022. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 10 
      papers reporting on the efficacy fluvoxamine in relieving depressive symptoms in 
      COVID-19 patients, and 3 papers on its effect on medical outcome. The 
      preponderance of data indicated a dual therapeutic action of fluvoxamine, and our 
      further literature investigation was informative about drug-drug interactions and 
      genetic factors moderating the antidepressant efficacy of fluvoxamine. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 seeking psychopharmacological treatment for 
      depressive symptoms must be informed of the benefits and risks of fluvoxamine 
      use. Several lines of findings indicate this agent to possess an additional 
      antiviral action. However, optimal dosage regimens and the trade-off with 
      drug-drug interactions remain unclear. Pharmacogenetic testing may assist in 
      evidence-based optimization of fluvoxamine dosages in the context of COVID-19 
      infection with comorbid depression.

TI  - What Is the Role of Palmitoylethanolamide Co-Ultramicronized with Luteolin on the 
      Symptomatology Reported by Patients Suffering from Long COVID? A Retrospective 
      Analysis Performed by a Group of General Practitioners in a Real-Life Setting.

LID - 3701
AB  - Long COVID is a recognized post-viral syndrome characterized by neurological, 
      somatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms that might last for long time after 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. An ever-growing number of patients come to the observation 
      of General Practitioners complaining of mild or moderate symptoms after the 
      resolution of the acute infection. Nine General Practitioners from the Rome area 
      (Italy) performed a retrospective analysis in order to evaluate the role of the 
      supplementation with Palmitoylethanolamide co-ultramicronized with Luteolin 
      (PEALUT) on neurologic and clinical symptoms reported by their patients after 
      COVID-19 resolution. Supplementation with PEALUT helped to improve all 
      patient-reported symptoms, especially pain, anxiety and depression, fatigue, 
      brain fog, anosmia and dysgeusia, leading to an overall improvement in patients' 
      health status. To our knowledge these are the first data presented on Long COVID 
      patients collected in a territorial setting. Despite their preliminary nature, 
      these results highlight the pathogenetic role of "non-resolving" 
      neuroinflammation in Long COVID development and consequently the importance of 
      its control in the resolution of the pathology and put the focus on the General 
      Practitioner as the primary figure for early detection and management of Long 
      COVID syndrome in a real-life setting. Future randomized, controlled, perspective 
      clinical trials are needed to confirm this preliminary observation.

AB  - Since the outbreak of the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in China, pharmacists have 
      rapidly engaged and developed strategies for pharmaceutical care and supply. 
      According to the guidelines of the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), 
      clinical pharmacists/hospital pharmacists, as members of care teams, play one of 
      the most important roles in the pharmaceutical care of patients with COVID-19. 
      During this pandemic, many immuno-enhancing adjuvant agents have become critical 
      in addition to antivirals and vaccines in order to overcome the disease more 
      easily. The liquid extract obtained from the Pelargonium sidoides plant is used 
      for many indications such as colds, coughs, upper respiratory tract infections, 
      sore throat, and acute bronchitis. The extract obtained from the roots of the 
      plant has been observed to have antiviral and immunomodulatory activity. In 
      addition to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, melatonin plays a role 
      in suppressing the cytokine storm that can develop during COVID-19 infection. 
      Knowing that the severity and duration of COVID-19 symptoms vary within 24 hours 
      and/or in different time periods indicates that COVID-19 requires a 
      chronotherapeutic approach. Our goal in the management of acute and long COVID is 
      to synchronize the medication regimen with the patient's biological rhythm. This 
      chapter provides a comprehensive review of the existing and emerging literature 
      on the chronobiological use of Pelargonium sidoides and melatonin during acute 
      and prolonged COVID-19 episodes.

AB  - Levocetirizine, a third-generation antihistamine, and montelukast, a leukotriene 
      receptor antagonist, exhibit remarkable synergistic anti-inflammatory activity 
      across a spectrum of signaling proteins, cell adhesion molecules, and leukocytes. 
      By targeting cellular protein activity, they are uniquely positioned to treat the 
      symptoms of COVID-19. Clinical data to date with an associated six-month 
      follow-up, suggests the combination therapy may prevent the progression of the 
      disease from mild to moderate to severe, as well as prevent/treat many of the 
      aspects of 'Long COVID,' thereby cost effectively reducing both morbidity and 
      mortality. To investigate patient outcomes, 53 consecutive COVID-19 test (+) 
      cases (ages 3-90) from a well-established, single-center practice in Boston, 
      Massachusetts, between March - November 2020, were treated with levocetirizine 
      and montelukast in addition to then existing protocols [2]. The data set was 
      retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-four cases were considered mild (64%), 17 
      moderate (32%), and 2 (4%) severe. Several patients presented with significant 
      comorbidities (obesity: n = 22, 41%; diabetes: n = 10, 19%; hypertension: n = 24, 
      45%). Among the cohort there were no exclusions, no intubations, and no deaths. 
      The pilot study in Massachusetts encompassed the first COVID-19 wave which peaked 
      on April 23, 2020 as well as the ascending portion of the second wave in the 
      fall. During this period the average weekly COVID-19 case mortality rate 
      (confirmed deaths/confirmed cases) varied considerably between 1 and 7.5% [37]. 
      FDA has approved a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical 
      trial design, replete with electronic diaries and laboratory metrics to explore

AB  - Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a clinical syndrome of 
      inappropriate increase in heart rate on standing that has been recently also 
      associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as part of the postacute 
      sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or long-COVID. We herein aimed to systematically 
      review reported cases of POTS after COVID-19 and determine the characteristics of 
      the subjects, the diagnostic approach used, and the treatment strategies. We 
      searched the literature according to the following criteria: (1) diagnosis of 
      POTS according to standard definition; (2) timely association with a probable or 
      definite diagnosis of COVID-19; and (3) a description of the individual 
      subject(s). We identified 21 reports meeting criteria between March 2020 and 
      September 2022, including 68 subjects (51 females and 17 males, 3:1 ratio) with a 
      mean age of 34 ± 12 years, with reports deriving from the United States, Norway, 
      Sweden, Israel, Ireland, United Kingdom, Singapore, and Japan. Most cases had 
      mild COVID-19 symptoms. The most common POTS symptoms were palpitations, chest 
      pain, lightheadedness, and debilitating fatigue. The diagnosis was established by 
      means of head-up tilt table or active stand test. Nonpharmacologic treatments 
      (fluids, sodium intake, and compression stockings) were virtually always used, 
      but largely ineffective. Subjects received different treatments, the most common 
      being beta-adrenergic blockers (ie, propranolol), mineral corticosteroids (ie, 
      fludrocortisone), midodrine, and ivabradine. Symptoms tended to improve over 
      time, but most patients remained symptomatic for several months. In conclusion, 
      POTS after COVID-19 is a clinical condition affecting young individuals, and 
      disproportionately young women, occurring as part of PASC-long-COVID, often 
      debilitating, which can be easily diagnosed with a thorough clinical assessment 
      and measuring changes in orthostatic heart rate and blood pressure. POTS after 
      COVID-19 seems to be poorly responsive to nonpharmacological treatments but with 
      symptoms improving with pharmacological interventions. Given the limited data 
      available, additional research is urgently needed with respect to its 
      epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Olfactory training is the only evidence-based treatment for 
      post-viral olfactory dysfunction. Smell disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection have 
      been attributed to neuroinflammatory events within the olfactory bulb and the 
      central nervous system. Therefore, targeting neuroinflammation is one potential 
      strategy for promoting recovery from post-COVID-19 chronic olfactory dysfunction. 
      Palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin (PEA-LUT) are candidate antiinflammatory/ 
      neuroprotective agents. OBJECTIVE: To investigate recovery of olfactory function 
      in patients treated with PEA-LUT oral supplements plus olfactory training versus 
      olfactory training plus placebo. METHODS: Multicenter double-blinded randomized 
      placebo-controlled clinical trial was held. Eligible subjects had prior COVID-19 
      and persistent olfactory impairment >6 months after follow-up SARS-CoV-2 negative 
      testing, without prior history of olfactory dysfunction or other sinonasal 
      disorders. Participants were randomized to daily oral supplementation with 
      ultramicronized PEA-LUT 770 mg plus olfactory training (intervention group) or 
      olfactory training with placebo (control). Sniffin' Sticks assessments were used 
      to test the patients at baseline and 90 days. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients, 
      including intervention (130) and control (55) were enrolled. The intervention 
      group showed significantly greater improvement in olfactory threshold, 
      discrimination, and identification scores compared to controls (p=0.0001). 
      Overall, 92% of patients in the intervention group improved versus 42% of 
      controls. Magnitude of recovery was significantly greater in the intervention 
      group versus control (12.8 + 8.2 versus mean 3.2 + 3), with >10-fold higher 
      prevalence of anosmia in control versus intervention groups at the 90-day 
      endpoint. CONCLUSION: Among individuals with olfactory dysfunction post-COVID-19, 
      combining PEA-LUT with olfactory training resulted in greater recovery of smell 
      than olfactory training alone.

AB  - Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) and sickle cell trait (SCT) have many 
      risk factors that could make them more susceptible to COVID-19 critical illness 
      and death compared to the general population. With a growing body of literature 
      in this field, a comprehensive review is needed. We reviewed 71 COVID-19-related 
      studies conducted in 15 countries and published between January 1, 2020, and 
      October 15, 2021, including a combined total of over 2000 patients with SCD and 
      nearly 2000 patients with SCT. Adults with SCD typically have a mild to moderate 
      COVID-19 disease course, but also a 2- to 7-fold increased risk of 
      COVID-19-related hospitalization and a 1.2-fold increased risk of 
      COVID-19-related death as compared to adults without SCD, but not compared to 
      controls with similar comorbidities and end-organ damage. There is some evidence 
      that persons with SCT have increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and 
      death although more studies with risk-stratification and properly matched 
      controls are needed to confirm these findings. While the literature suggests that 
      most children with SCD and COVID-19 have mild disease and low risk of death, some 
      children with SCD, especially those with SCD-related comorbidities, are more 
      likely to be hospitalized and require escalated care than children without SCD. 
      However, children with SCD are less likely to experience COVID-19-related severe 
      illness and death compared to adults with or without SCD. SCD-directed therapies 
      such as transfusion and hydroxyurea may be associated with better COVID-19 
      outcomes, but prospective studies are needed for confirmation. While some studies 
      have reported favorable short-term outcomes for COVID-19 patients with SCD and 
      SCT, the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown and may affect 
      individuals with SCD and SCT differently from the general population. Important 
      focus areas for future research should include multi-center studies with larger 
      sample sizes, assessment of hemoglobin genotype and SCD-modifying therapies on 
      COVID-19 outcomes, inclusion of case-matched controls that account for the unique 
      sample characteristics of SCD and SCT populations, and longitudinal assessment of 
      post-COVID-19 symptoms.

TI  - Could SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Be Responsible for Long-COVID Syndrome?
PG  - 1850-1861
LID - 10.1007/s12035-021-02696-0 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via its spike protein binding to its surface receptor on 
      target cells and results in acute symptoms involving especially the lungs known 
      as COVID-19. However, increasing evidence indicates that many patients develop a 
      chronic condition characterized by fatigue and neuropsychiatric symptoms, termed 
      long-COVID. Most of the vaccines produced so far for COVID-19 direct mammalian 
      cells via either mRNA or an adenovirus vector to express the spike protein, or 
      administer recombinant spike protein, which is recognized by the immune system 
      leading to the production of neutralizing antibodies. Recent publications provide 
      new findings that may help decipher the pathogenesis of long-COVID. One paper 
      reported perivascular inflammation in brains of deceased patients with COVID-19, 
      while others showed that the spike protein could damage the endothelium in an 
      animal model, that it could disrupt an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier 
      (BBB), and that it can cross the BBB resulting in perivascular inflammation. 
      Moreover, the spike protein appears to share antigenic epitopes with human 
      molecular chaperons resulting in autoimmunity and can activate toll-like 
      receptors (TLRs), leading to release of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, some 
      antibodies produced against the spike protein may not be neutralizing, but may 
      change its conformation rendering it more likely to bind to its receptor. As a 
      result, one wonders whether the spike protein entering the brain or being 
      expressed by brain cells could activate microglia, alone or together with 
      inflammatory cytokines, since protective antibodies could not cross the BBB, 
      leading to neuro-inflammation and contributing to long-COVID. Hence, there is 
      urgent need to better understand the neurotoxic effects of the spike protein and 
      to consider possible interventions to mitigate spike protein-related detrimental 
      effects to the brain, possibly via use of small natural molecules, especially the 
      flavonoids luteolin and quercetin.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) is a frequent phenomenon of patients who 
      have suffered from an acute attack of COVID-19 infection, and it is characterized 
      by a wide range of symptoms from different organs and systems including the 
      musculoskeletal system (MSS). However, peculiarities of MSS lesions have not been 
      sufficiently studied to date, in particular, in the aspect of the therapeutic 
      process. We aimed to investigate peculiarities of MSS lesions in patients with 
      PCS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observations were carried out in 142 patients with PCS 
      and MSS lesions. The age of patients was 36-67 years. Up-to-date methods of 
      disease verification were used. An acute period of COVID-19 in all the patients 
      was of moderate severity without oxygen support. RESULTS: Musculoskeletal system 
      lesions in patients with PCS were found to appear 1-4 weeks after the experienced 
      acute period of COVID-19 infection. Against the background of significant 
      arthralgia (100%) in 93 (65.5%) patients manifestations of acute arthritis were 
      detected, the frequency of which increased with age. Musculoskeletal system 
      lesions were found against the background of dominating PCS manifestations from 
      the cardiovascular and digestive systems. Deterioration of the course and results 
      of treatment of diseases caused by an age-related polymorbid background was 
      determined. Certain difficulties in the treatment of MSS lesions by means of 
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and limitation in the use of 
      glucocorticosteroids are caused by severe gastroduodenopathy and arterial 
      hypertension. Long-term, up to 6 months, administration of L-arginine, 
      L-carnitine and quercetin in the rehabilitation complex improved the overall 
      results of treatment of PCS manifestations including arthropathy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Musculoskeletal system lesions in patients with PCS are not the main constituent 
      of this syndrome. Difficulties in the treatment of arthropathy are due to the 
      signs of gastroduodenopathy and arterial hypertension. Additional administration 
      of L-arginine, L-carnitine and quercetin is reasonable.

PG  - 1439-1447
LID - 10.1042/CS20220638 [doi]
AB  - This perspective considers the benefits of the potential future use of the cell 
      permeant calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, as a drug to treat severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Recent work has 
      reported calpeptin's capacity to inhibit entry of the virus into cells. 
      Elsewhere, several drugs, including calpeptin, were found to be able to inhibit 
      extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis. Unsurprisingly, because of similarities 
      between viral and EV release mechanisms, calpeptin has also been shown to inhibit 
      viral egress. This approach, identifying calpeptin, through large-scale screening 
      studies as a candidate drug to treat COVID-19, however, has not considered the 
      longer term likely benefits of calpain inhibition, post-COVID-19. This 
      perspective will reflect on the capacity of calpeptin for treating long COVID by 
      inhibiting the overproduction of neutrophil extracellular traps potentially 
      damaging lung cells and promoting clotting, together with limiting associated 
      chronic inflammation, tissue damage and pulmonary fibrosis. It will also reflect 
      on the tolerated and detrimental in vivo side-effects of calpain inhibition from 
      various preclinical studies.

TI  - Psychiatric manifestations of post-COVID-19 syndrome: the potential benefit of 
      Silexan.
PG  - 285-291
LID - 10.1080/13651501.2023.2187308 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Psychiatric symptoms are common and bothersome in individuals with 
      post-COVID-19 syndrome. Because they are often mixed and subthreshold, 
      established treatment regimens cannot be applied. There is an urgent need to 
      identify therapeutics for affected patients. Silexan, a proprietary essential oil 
      from Lavandula angustifolia, has demonstrated efficacy against anxiety, comorbid 
      symptoms, and subthreshold and mixed syndromes. The aim of the current narrative 
      review is to examine the therapeutic potential of Silexan for psychiatric 
      manifestations in patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome.Methods: We reviewed 
      clinical evidence regarding the efficacy of Silexan and first clinical experience 
      in patients with psychiatric symptoms attributable to the post-COVID-19 syndrome. 
      Furthermore, we discussed potential modes of action based on nonclinical 
      data.Results: Silexan has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of 
      generalised anxiety disorder; subsyndromal anxiety disorders; comorbid 
      depressive, somatic, and sleep disturbance symptoms; and mixed anxiety and 
      depression. Emerging clinical experience also suggests the effectiveness and 
      tolerability of Silexan for patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome. This can be 
      explained by the fact that the therapeutic profile of Silexan overlaps with the 
      spectrum of psychiatric symptoms in such patients.Conclusion: Preliminary 
      findings indicate a promising potential of Silexan for the treatment of 
      psychiatric manifestations in patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome.Key 
      pointsAnxiety and mixed neuropsychiatric manifestations are commonly observed in 
      patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome.Silexan has anxiolytic properties and can 
      alleviate comorbid depressive, somatic, and sleep impairment symptoms.Silexan 
      exhibits several biological mechanisms, such as neurotrophic and 
      anti-inflammatory properties, which have the potential to positively impact 
      post-COVID-19 disease.Silexan has a favourable safety profile and high acceptance 
      among patients.Emerging data suggest that Silexan can alleviate neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms in patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome.Silexan should be considered as 
      a therapeutic in patients with psychiatric manifestations of post-COVID-19 
      syndrome.

LID - 10.1097/JCP.0000000000001543 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Studies for repurposed drugs in severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus type 2-infected and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      patients are ongoing. According to preclinical research, antidepressants (ADs) 
      might be useful in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS/PROCEDURES: We conducted a 
      scoping review including clinical studies on AD effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      and COVID-19. FINDING/RESULTS: As of January 2, 2022, we found 14 clinical 
      studies, which could be included into this review. Among them, there were 2 
      randomized, placebo-controlled studies and 2 prospective parallel-group studies 
      about the efficacy/effectiveness and tolerability of fluvoxamine. The remaining 
      studies were mainly retrospective studies considering COVID-19 hospital 
      populations predominantly exposed to fluoxetine (N = 3), other selective 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), selective norepinephrine reuptake 
      inhibitors (SNRI), and trazodone. The vast majority were hospital studies and 
      assessed COVID-19 severity (morbidity) and mortality as primary endpoints. The 
      only outpatient study (fluvoxamine) investigated the COVID-19-related 
      hospitalization rate, and 1 psychiatric hospital study (SSRI, SNRI, trazodone) 
      focused on the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: At present, 
      the best evidence of an "anti-COVID-19" potential of ADs exists for fluvoxamine 
      and, to a lesser extent, for fluoxetine. Preliminary evidence had found that 
      patients exposed to SSRI or SNRI substance classes might have a reduced mortality 
      risk and that trazodone might reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. Three studies 
      found no relevant influence of ADs on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and 1 
      study described increased mortality. The latter study, however, did not 
      differentiate between psychotropic medication and ADs. Tricyclics and monoamine 
      oxidase inhibitors are still absolute "dark zones" in COVID-19 research. Further 
      controlled studies testing the effectiveness/efficacy and tolerability/safety (as 
      well as the treatment timing and duration) of different AD substance classes in 
      COVID-19 and post/long-COVID patients of various populations are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug use is prevalent among people who attend electronic dance music 
      (EDM) parties at nightclubs or festivals. This population can serve as a sentinel 
      population to monitor trends in use of party drugs and new psychoactive 
      substances (NPS) that may diffuse through larger segments of the population. 
      METHODS: We surveyed adults entering randomly selected EDM parties at nightclubs 
      and dance festivals in New York City about their drug use in 2017 (n=954), 2018 
      (n=1,029), 2019 (n=606), 2021 (n=229), and 2022 (n=419). We estimated trends in 
      past-year and past-month use of 22 drugs or drug classes based on self-report 
      from 2017-2022 and examined whether there were shifts pre- vs. post-COVID 
      (2017-2019 vs. 2021-2022). RESULTS: Between 2017 and 2022, there were increases 
      in past-year and past-month use of shrooms (psilocybin), ketamine, poppers 
      (amyl/butyl nitrites), synthetic cathinones ("bath salts"), and novel 
      psychedelics (lysergamides and DOx series), increases in past-year cannabis use, 
      and increases in past-month use of 2C series drugs. Between 2017 and 2022, there 
      were decreases in past-year heroin use and decreases in past-month cocaine use, 
      novel stimulant use, and nonmedical benzodiazepine use. The odds of use of 
      shrooms, poppers, and 2C series drugs significantly increased after COVID, and 
      the odds of use of cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, methamphetamine, novel stimulants, 
      and prescription opioids (nonmedical use) decreased post-COVID. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      estimate shifts in prevalence of various drugs among this sentinel population, 
      which can inform ongoing surveillance efforts and public health response in this 
      and the general populations.

TI  - Potential Beneficial Effects of Naringin and Naringenin on Long COVID-A Review of 
      the Literature.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms12020332 [doi]
LID - 332
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused a severe epidemic due to severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent studies have found that 
      patients do not completely recover from acute infections, but instead, suffer 
      from a variety of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, known as long 
      COVID. The effects of long COVID can be far-reaching, with a duration of up to 
      six months and a range of symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, immune 
      dysregulation, microbiota dysbiosis, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue 
      syndrome, myocarditis, pulmonary fibrosis, cough, diabetes, pain, reproductive 
      dysfunction, and thrombus formation. However, recent studies have shown that 
      naringenin and naringin have palliative effects on various COVID-19 sequelae. 
      Flavonoids such as naringin and naringenin, commonly found in fruits and 
      vegetables, have various positive effects, including reducing inflammation, 
      preventing viral infections, and providing antioxidants. This article discusses 
      the molecular mechanisms and clinical effects of naringin and naringenin on 
      treating the above diseases. It proposes them as potential drugs for the 
      treatment of long COVID, and it can be inferred that naringin and naringenin 
      exhibit potential as extended long COVID medications, in the future likely 
      serving as nutraceuticals or clinical supplements for the comprehensive 
      alleviation of the various manifestations of COVID-19 complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Long COVID is a major health concern because many patients develop 
      chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms, but the precise pathogenesis is unknown. 
      Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) can disrupt neuronal connectivity and be 
      elevated in patients with long COVID. METHODS: In this study, MMP-9 was measured 
      in the serum of long COVID patients and healthy controls, as well as in the 
      supernatant fluid of cultured human microglia cell line stimulated by recombinant 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Spike protein, as well as 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and neurotensin (NT) used as positive controls. MMP-9 
      was measured by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: MMP-9 was 
      significantly elevated in the serum of long COVID patients compared to healthy 
      controls. Moreover, there was significant release of MMP-9 from a cultured human 
      microglia cell line stimulated by LPS, NT, or Spike protein. We further show that 
      pretreatment with the flavonoids luteolin and tetramethoxyluteolin (methlut) 
      significantly inhibited the release of MMP-9 stimulated by the Spike protein. 
      CONCLUSION: MMP-9 from Spike protein-stimulated microglia could contribute to the 
      development of long COVID and may serve as a target for treatment including the 
      use of luteolin.

LID - CD013876
AB  - BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is an early and sensitive marker of COVID-19 
      infection. Although self-limiting in the majority of cases, when hyposmia or 
      anosmia persists it can have a profound effect on quality of life. Little 
      guidance exists on the treatment of post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction, however 
      several strategies have been proposed from the evidence relating to the treatment 
      of post-viral anosmia (such as medication or olfactory training). OBJECTIVES: To 
      assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions that have been used, or 
      proposed, to treat persisting olfactory dysfunction due to COVID-19 infection. A 
      secondary objective is to keep the evidence up-to-date, using a living systematic 
      review approach.  SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist 
      searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register; Cochrane ENT Register; CENTRAL; 
      Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and 
      additional sources for published and unpublished studies. The date of the search 
      was 16 December 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials including 
      participants who had symptoms of olfactory disturbance following COVID-19 
      infection. Only individuals who had symptoms for at least four weeks were 
      included in this review. Studies compared any intervention with no treatment or 
      placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological 
      procedures. Primary outcomes were the recovery of sense of smell, disease-related 
      quality of life and serious adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were the change 
      in sense of smell, general quality of life, prevalence of parosmia and other 
      adverse effects (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess 
      the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included one 
      study with 18 participants, which compared the use of a 15-day course of oral 
      steroids combined with nasal irrigation (consisting of an intranasal 
      steroid/mucolytic/decongestant solution) with no intervention. Psychophysical 
      testing was used to assess olfactory function at baseline, 20 and 40 days. 
      Systemic corticosteroids plus intranasal steroid/mucolytic/decongestant compared 
      to no intervention Recovery of sense of smell was assessed after 40 days (25 days 
      after cessation of treatment) using the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical 
      Research Center (CCCRC) score. This tool has a range of 0 to 100, and a score of 
      ≥ 90 represents normal olfactory function. The evidence is very uncertain about 
      the effect of this intervention on recovery of the sense of smell at one to three 
      months (5/9 participants in the intervention group scored ≥ 90 compared to 0/9 in 
      the control group; risk ratio (RR) 11.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 
      173.66; 1 study; 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Change in sense 
      of smell was assessed using the CCCRC score at 40 days. This study reported an 
      improvement in sense of smell in the intervention group from baseline (median 
      improvement in CCCRC score 60, interquartile range (IQR) 40) compared to the 
      control group (median improvement in CCCRC score 30, IQR 25) (1 study; 18 
      participants; very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events andother 
      adverse events were not identified in any participants of this study; however, it 
      is unclear how these outcomes were assessed and recorded (1 study; 18 
      participants; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very 
      limited evidence available on the efficacy and harms of treatments for persistent 
      olfactory dysfunction following COVID-19 infection. However, we have identified 
      other ongoing trials in this area. As this is a living systematic review we will 
      update the data regularly, as new results become available. For this (first) 
      version of the living review we identified only one study with a small sample 
      size, which assessed systemic steroids and nasal irrigation (intranasal 
      steroid/mucolytic/decongestant). However, the evidence regarding the benefits and 
      harms from this intervention to treat persistent post-COVID-19 olfactory 
      dysfunction is very uncertain.

AB  - Lutein, a plant-derived xanthophyl-carotenoid, is an exceptional antioxidant and 
      anti-inflammatory constituent found in food. High dietary intake of lutein is 
      beneficial against eye disease, improves cardiometabolic health, protects from 
      neurodegenerative diseases, and is beneficial for liver, kidney, and respiratory 
      health. Lutein protects against oxidative and nitrosative stress, both of which 
      play a major role in long COVID and mRNA vaccination injury syndromes. Lutein is 
      an important natural agent for therapeutic use against oxidative and nitrosative 
      stress in chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases 
      and cancer. It can also potentially inhibit spike protein-induced inflammation. 
      Rich dietary supplementation of lutein, naturally derived in non-biodegradable 
      Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), can most optimally be used against oxidative and 
      nitrosative stress during post-COVID and mRNA vaccination injury syndromes. Due 
      to its high oleic acid (OA) content, EVOO supports optimal absorption of dietary 
      lutein. The main molecular pathways by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces 
      pathology, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer activated B cells (NF-κB) 
      and activated protein (AP)-1, can be suppressed by lutein. Synergy with other 
      natural compounds for spike protein detoxification is likely.

AB  - The development of pulmonary fibrosis is a rare complication of the novel 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Limited information is available in the 
      literature about that, and the present study aimed to address this gap.This 
      case-control study included 64 patients with post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis who 
      were hospitalized for COVID-19.The percentage of patients aged ≥65 years (44%) 
      who demised was higher than those who survived (25%). Male patients (62%) had 
      higher mortality than female patients (37%). The most frequently reported 
      clinical symptoms were shortness of breath (98%), cough (91%), and fever (70%). 
      Most COVID-19 patients with pulmonary fibrosis (81%) were admitted to an 
      intensive care unit (ICU), and 63% required mechanical ventilation. Bilateral 
      lung infiltrates (94%), "ground glass" opacity (91%), "honeycomb" lung (25%), and 
      pulmonary consolidation (9%) were commonly identified in COVID-19 patients with 
      pulmonary fibrosis who survived. The findings for computed tomography and dyspnea 
      scale were significantly higher in severe cases admitted to the ICU who required 
      mechanical ventilation. A higher computerized tomography score also correlated 
      significantly with a longer duration of stay in hospital and a higher degree of 
      dyspnea. Half of the COVID-19 patients with pulmonary fibrosis (50%) who survived 
      required oxygen therapy, and those with "honeycomb" lung required long-term 
      oxygen therapy to a far greater extent than others. Cox regression revealed that 
      smoking and asthma were significantly associated with ICU admission and the risk 
      of mortality.Post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is a severe complication that leads 
      to permanent lung damage or death.

AB  - We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess whether treatment with 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was associated with a reduced risk of long COVID. We 
      enrolled 500 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who were eligible for 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; 250 who took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 250 who did not. 
      The primary outcome was the development of one or more of eleven prespecified 
      long COVID symptoms, assessed through a structured telephone interview four 
      months after the positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Multivariable logistic regression 
      models controlled for age, sex, race/ethnicity, chronic conditions, and COVID-19 
      vaccination status. We found that participants who took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
      were no less likely to develop long COVID symptoms, compared to those who did not 
      take the medication (44% vs. 49.6%, p = 0.21). Taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was 
      associated with a lower odds of two of the eleven long COVID symptoms, brain fog 
      (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.88) and chest pain/tightness (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.91). 
      Our finding that treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was not associated with a 
      lower risk of developing long COVID is different from prior studies that obtained 
      data only from electronic medical records.

LID - 10.21873/invivo.13786 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified inquiries into the 
      interplay between diabetes and disease severity, and the long-term impact of 
      long-COVID. This study specifically explored the implications of different 
      antithrombotic treatments on COVID-19 patients. It aimed to assess the long-term 
      efficacy and safety of Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) in mitigating thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: We conducted a study on 157 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from 
      August 2021 to August 2023. The study evaluated shifts in anticoagulant therapy 
      recommendations, tracking the transition from VKA to DOACs, and analyzed 
      associated health outcomes. RESULTS: A significant shift from VKA to DOACs 
      prescriptions was observed, especially in high-risk patients. Despite the change 
      in antithrombotic treatments, incidences of varices and varices with hemorrhoids 
      increased by 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively. Long-COVID was also linked to higher 
      occurrences of diabetes and gastrointestinal diseases. Joint diseases rose by 
      14%, indicating persistent inflammation. Cardiomyopathies increased by 3.9%, 
      predominantly in high-risk groups, and psychoanxiety disorders surged by 39.5%, 
      highlighting the need for further research. DOAC usage was more common in older 
      age groups, with a 10.2% increase in recommendations among high-risk patients 
      (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The study underscores the evolving landscape of 
      antithrombotic therapy in managing COVID-19 complications. Despite the increased 
      use of DOACs, the rise in various health conditions suggests the necessity for 
      personalized treatment strategies tailored to patient risk profiles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long COVID, characterized by persistent multi-organ symptoms 
      post-SARS-CoV-2 infection, poses a substantial global health burden. While 
      diverse therapeutic interventions have been proposed, their comparative efficacy 
      remains uncertain due to fragmented evidence and methodological heterogeneity in 
      prior studies. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to comprehensively explore 
      the effectiveness of diverse therapeutic interventions in long COVID. METHODS: In 
      this meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, 
      SPORTDiscus (EBSCO), CINAHL (EBSCO), and Rehabilitation & Sports medicine source 
      (EBSCO) from inception to July 20, 2025, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      evaluating exercise training, respiratory muscle training, telerehabilitation, 
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), olfactory training, 
      palmitoylethanolamide with luteolin (PEA-LUT), and steroid sprays in adults with 
      Long COVID. Primary outcomes included cardiopulmonary function, exercise 
      capacity, fatigue, and olfactory recovery. Data were pooled using random-effects 
      models, with sensitivity analyses (leave-one-out method) and Egger's test to 
      assess robustness and publication bias. GRADE criteria evaluated evidence 
      certainty. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024591704). FINDINGS: We 
      identified a total of 51 eligible trials, comprising 4026 participants. 
      Significant differences were observed in the following outcomes in the context of 
      exercise training: 6MWT (MD, 83.20; 95% CI 52.04-114.37), 30sSTS (MD, 3.05; 95% 
      CI 1.96-4.13), SF-12 Mental Component Summary (SF-12-MCS) (MD, 3.10; 95% CI 
      0.78-5.43), VO2 peak (% predicted) (MD, 6.00; 95% CI 0.45-11.54), VO2 peak 
      (L/kg/min) (MD, 1.61; 95% CI 0.40-2.81), VO2 peak (L/min) (MD, 0.14; 95% CI 
      0.03-0.25), mMRC dyspnea scale (MD, -1.04; 95% CI -1.73 to -0.35), the 
      Multidimensional Functional Assessment of Daily Living Scale (MBDS) (MD, -4.61;

      following key outcomes: 6MWT (MD, 89.54; 95% CI 9.86-169.23), MIP (% predicted) 
      (MD, 15.79; 95% CI 2.73-28.84), MIP (cm H(2)O) (MD, 19.69; 95% CI 10.14-29.24), 
      and mMRC (MD, -1.02; 95% CI -1.86 to -0.18) in respiratory muscle training; 6MWT 
      (MD 34.14; 95% CI 2.54-65.74), 30sSTS (MD 1.41; 95% CI 0.67-2.15), and FSS (MD 
      -1.59; 95% CI -2.64 to -0.53) in telerehabilitation; MFIS-physical (MD, -2.29; 
      95% CI -4.36 to -0.22) in tDCS; and TDI Score (MD, 4.66; 95% CI 2.16-7.15) in 
      PEA-LUT. INTERPRETATION: Exercise training should be prioritized for improving 
      cardiopulmonary function and exercise capacity in Long COVID, supported by 
      high-certainty evidence. Respiratory muscle training and PEA-LUT offer targeted 
      benefits for respiratory strength and anosmia, while tDCS may address fatigue. 
      Telerehabilitation, as a form of supervision, also improved the effectiveness of 
      the intervention. In contrast, steroid sprays and olfactory training lack 
      efficacy, highlighting the need for personalized, symptom-specific approaches. 
      These findings advocate for updated clinical guidelines integrating multimodal 
      therapies and underscore the urgency of large-scale trials to optimize dosing and 
      long-term outcomes. FUNDING: This study was supported by the Hunan Provincial 
      Natural Foundation of China (2021JJ30040), the National Key Research and 
      Development Plan (2022YFC3601900, 2022YFC2505500), the National Clinical Research

AB  - The outbreak of a fatal black fungus infection after the resurgence of the 
      cadaverous COVID-19 has exhorted scientists worldwide to develop a nutshell by 
      repurposing or designing new formulations to address the crisis. Patients 
      expressing COVID-19 are more susceptible to Mucormycosis (MCR) and thus fall easy 
      prey to decease accounting for this global threat. Their mortality rates range 
      around 32-70% depending on the organs affected and grow even higher despite the 
      treatment. The many contemporary recommendations strongly advise using liposomal 
      amphotericin B and surgery as first-line therapy whenever practicable. MCR is a 
      dangerous infection that requires an antifungal drug administration on 
      appropriate prescription, typically one of the following: Amphotericin B, 
      Posaconazole, or Isavuconazole since the fungi that cause MCR are resistant to 
      other medications like fluconazole, voriconazole, and echinocandins. Amphotericin 
      B and Posaconazole are administered through veins (intravenously), and 
      isavuconazole by mouth (orally). From last several years so many compounds are 
      developed against invasive fungal disease but only few of them are able to induce 
      effective treatment against the micorals. Adjuvant medicines, more particularly, 
      are difficult to assess without prospective randomized controlled investigations, 
      which are challenging to conduct given the lower incidence and higher mortality 
      from Mucormycosis. The present analysis provides insight into pathogenesis, 
      epidemiology, clinical manifestations, underlying fungal virulence, and growth 
      mechanisms. In addition, current therapy for MCR in Post Covid-19 individuals 
      includes conventional and novel nano-based advanced management systems for 
      procuring against deadly fungal infection. The study urges involving nanomedicine 
      to prevent fungal growth at the commencement of infection, delay the progression, 
      and mitigate fatality risk.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in cardiovascular and immune systems. 
      Quantification of blood nitrite and nitrate, two relatively stable metabolites of 
      NO (generally as NO(x)), has been acknowledged, in part, representing NO 
      bioactivity. Dysregulation of NO(x) had been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infected 
      populations, but whether patients recovered from COVID-19 disease present with 
      restored NO(x) is unknown. In this study, serum NO(2)(-) and NO(3)(-) were 
      quantified and analyzed among 109 recovered adults in comparison to a control 
      group of 166 uninfected adults. Nitrite or nitrate levels were not significantly 
      different among mild-, common-, severe- and critical-type patients. However, 
      these recovered patients had dramatically lower NO(2)(-) and NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-) 
      than the uninfected group (p < 0.0001), with significantly higher NO(3)(-) levels 
      (p = 0.0023) than the uninfected group. Nitrate and nitrite/nitrate were 
      positively and negatively correlated with patient age, respectively, with age 65 
      being a turning point among recovered patients. These results indicate that low 
      NO(2)(-), low NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-) and high NO(3)(-) may be potential biomarkers of 
      long-term poor or irreversible outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. It suggests 
      that NO metabolites might serve as a predictor to track the health status of 
      recovered COVID-19 patients, highlighting the need to elucidate the role of NO 
      after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - The Role of Mitochondria in Phytochemically Mediated Disease Amelioration.
PG  - 6775-6788
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.2c08921 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction may cause cell death, which has recently emerged as a 
      cancer prevention and treatment strategy mediated by chemotherapy drugs or 
      phytochemicals. However, most existing drugs cannot target cancerous cells and 
      may adversely affect normal cells via side effects. Mounting studies have 
      revealed that phytochemicals such as resveratrol could ameliorate various 
      diseases with dysfunctional or damaged mitochondria. For instance, resveratrol 
      can regulate mitophagy, inhibit oxidative stress and preserve membrane potential, 
      induce mitochondrial biogenesis, balance mitochondrial fusion and fission, and 
      enhance the functionality of the electron transport chain. However, there are 
      only a few studies suggesting that phytochemicals could potentially protect 
      against the cytotoxicity of some current cancer drugs, especially those that 
      damage mitochondria. Besides, COVID-19 and long COVID have also been reported to 
      be correlated to mitochondrial dysfunction. Curcumin has been reported bringing a 
      positive impact on COVID-19 and long COVID. Therefore, in this study, the 
      benefits of resveratrol and curcumin to be applied for cancer 
      treatment/prevention and disease amelioration were reviewed. Besides, this review 
      also provides some perspectives on phytochemicals to be considered as a treatment 
      adjuvant for COVID-19 and long COVID by targeting mitochondrial rescue. 
      Hopefully, this review can provide new insight into disease treatment with 
      phytochemicals targeting mitochondria.

TI  - Pycnogenol®-Centellicum® supplementation improves lung fibrosis and post-COVID-19 
      lung healing.
PG  - 135-140

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the combination of 
      Pycnogenol(®) (150 mg/day) (Horphag Research, London, UK) and Centella asiatica 
      (Centellicum(®) 3×225 mg/day; Horphag Research) (PY-CE) for 8 months in subjects 
      with sequelae of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). Recently, post-COVID-19 
      lung disease is emerging with large numbers of patients left with chronic lung 
      conditions. Considering the antifibrotic activity of the combination PY-CE, we 
      also tested this supplementary management in post-COVID-19 lung patients. 
      METHODS: Nineteen subjects with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) were 
      included in the study. High Resolution CT scans at inclusion confirmed the 
      presence of lung fibrosis: 10 patients were treated with the Pycnogenol(®) 
      Centellicum(®) combination and 9 subjects with standard management (SM) served as 
      controls. Oxidative stress that was very high in all subjects at inclusion, 
      decreased significantly in the supplement group (P<0.05). The Karnofsky 
      Performance Scale Index significantly improved in the supplement group in 
      comparison with controls (P<0.05). The symptoms (fatigue, muscular pain, dyspnea) 
      were significantly lower after 8 months in supplemented patients (P<0.05) as 
      compared with controls. RESULTS: At the end of the study, the small cystic 
      lesions (honeycombing) and traction bronchiectasis were stable or in partial 
      regression in 4 subjects in the supplemented group (vs. none in the control 
      group) with a significant improvement in tissue edema in the supplemented 
      subjects. On ultrasound lung scans the white (more echogenic) fibrotic component 
      at inclusion was 18.5±2.2% in the images in controls vs. 19.4±2.7% in the 
      supplement group. At the end of the study, there was no improvement in controls 
      (18.9±2.5%) vs. a significant improvement in supplemented subjects (16.2±2.1%; 
      P<0.05). In addition, 18 subjects with post-COVID-19 lung disease were included 
      in the study; 10 patients were treated with the Pycnogenol(®) Centellicum(®) 
      combination and evaluated after 4 weeks; 8 patients served as controls. 
      Preliminary results show that symptoms associated with post-COVID-19 lung disease 
      after 4 weeks were significantly improved with the supplement combination 
      (P<0.05). Oxidative stress and the Karnofsky Performance Scale Index were 
      significantly improved in the supplements group as compared with controls 
      (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: According to these observations, Pycnogenol(®) controls 
      and decreases edema and Centellicum(®) by modulating the apposition of collagen, 
      slows down the development of irregular cicatrization, the keloidal scarring and 
      fibrosis. More time is needed to evaluate this effect in a larger number of 
      post-COVID-19 patients with lung disease. This disease has affected millions of 
      subjects worldwide, leaving severe consequences. Pycnogenol(®) and Centellicum(®) 
      may improve the residual clinical picture in post-COVID-19 lung disease (PCL) 
      patients and may reduce the number of subjects evolving into lung fibrosis. The 
      evolution from edema to fibrosis seems to be slower or attenuated with this 
      supplement combination both in Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and in PCL 
      patients.

AB  - The new coronavirus infection represents a serious threat to global health and 
      economies. In this sense, it is paramount to know the nutritional factors that 
      may be related to the prognosis of the disease. Evidence shows that vitamin A may 
      play an important preventive and therapeutic role in supporting respiratory 
      infections as in COVID-19. The aim of our study was to evaluate the association 
      of vitamin A (retinol) status with the prognosis of the disease. A case-control 
      study from a cohort study was conducted in Brazil between May and October 2020. 
      The study population was chosen by convenience, consisting of participants 
      diagnosed with COVID-19. Recruitment was carried out using different approaches, 
      including through dissemination on social media and in four hospitals in the city 
      of Natal/RN, Brazil, recruiting participants from the COVID-19 ward and 
      hospitalized participants who tested positive for the disease. The participants 
      were allocated into two groups according to severity, with a group of mild (n = 
      88) or critical (n = 106) patients and compared to a control group (selected 
      before the pandemic, n = 46). The extraction of retinol serum was performed and 
      analyzed using the high-performance liquid chromatography method (HPLC). The 
      retinol level was calculated in mmol/L, and levels below 0.7 μmol/L (20 µg/dL) 
      were considered to be a vitamin A deficiency. Our findings suggest that the 
      participants with mild and critical COVID-19 had lower retinol levels compared to 
      the healthy controls (p = 0.03). In addition, milder cases of COVID-19 were 
      associated with increased symptoms and prolonged symptoms after 90 days since the 
      beginning of infection. However, the survival analysis showed no association with 
      higher cases of death among participants with vitamin A deficiency (p = 0.509). 
      More studies are needed to understand how nutritional status, including vitamin A 
      levels, can influence prognosis and is a risk factor for the development of long 
      COVID syndrome.

AB  - Breakthrough infections have been reported in fully vaccinated persons. 
      Furthermore, rebound symptoms have been reported following the new FDA granted 
      emergency use to combat SARS-CoV-2. Glycyrrhizin (GR) and boswellic acids (BAs) 
      combination has been shown to have highly successful actions against COVID-19 in 
      our recent clinical trial. However, the study is limited by the small sample 
      size, and therefore, the aim of this article is to comprehensively evaluate 
      recent evidence on the efficacy of GR and BAs in preventing the development of 
      COVID-19 in patients with mild and moderate infections and in preventing 
      post-COVID-19 cognitive impairment, which is the most important symptom after 
      recovery from Covid-19 disease. We have reviewed and discussed information 
      published since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic until July 2022 on 
      preclinical (in vivo, in vivo and bioinformatics) and clinical studies related to 
      the antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity of Gr and BAs. 
      Sixteen studies were performed to determine the efficacy of GR against 
      SARS-CoV-2. Ten studies were used primarily for in vitro and in vivo assays and 
      six used molecular docking studies. However, the antiviral activity of BAs 
      against SARS-CoV-2 was determined in only five studies using molecular modeling 
      and bioinformatics. All these studies confirmed that GR n and BAs have strong 
      antiviral activity and can be used as a therapeutic agent for COVID-19 and as a 
      protective agent against SARS-CoV-2. They may act by inhibiting the main protease 
      SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) responsible for replication and blocking spike protein-mediated 
      cell entry. Only seven rigorously designed clinical trials regarding the 
      usefulness of GR, BAs or their combinations in the treatment of COVID-19 have 
      been published as of July 2022. Although there is no clinical study regarding the 
      treatment of cognitive impairment after COVID-19 that has been published so far, 
      several preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the potential effect 
      of GR and BAs in the prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment by 
      inhibiting the activity of several molecules that activate inflammatory signaling 
      pathway. In conclusion, the findings of our study documented the beneficial use 
      of GR and BAs to treat SARS-CoV-2 and its variants and prevent post-COVID 
      cognitive impairment. However, it warrants further studies with a larger 
      randomized sample size to ensure that the studies have sufficient evidence of 
      benefits against COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aim: Evaluation of the effectiveness of the early 8-week monotherapy 
      with escitalopram as a form of proactive psychosomatic intervention for patients 
      with post-COVID depression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 44 
      patients with post-COVID depression were involved in a proactive psychosomatic 
      intervention in the form of an 8-week intake of escitalopram (Medogram, 
      Medochemiе Ltd) for 2-8 weeks in the case of a diagnosis of severe depression. 
      Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS-8), Quality of Life 
      Scale (CQLS) were used to assess symptoms and status dynamics. RESULTS: Results: 
      Patients with post-COVID depression after an 8-week course of escitalopram 
      therapy showed a significant reduction in mental and somatic symptoms of 
      depression and an improvement in quality of life. At the time of enrollment in 
      the study, 12 (28.58%) individuals had mild depression, 15 (35.71%) had moderate 
      depression, and 15 (35.71%) had severe depression. At the end of the 8th weeks of 
      taking the drug in 24 (57.14%) there were no signs of depression on the HAM-D 
      scale, in 18 people there were subclinical manifestations of depression. The 
      effectiveness of escitalopram in reducing the symptoms of depression in this 
      study was 66%. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: With the introduction of pharmacotherapy 
      with escitalopram there was a significant reduction in mental and so¬matic 
      symptoms of depression and an improvement in quality of life. Escitalopram 
      (Medochemie Ltd) may be an effective drug for psychopharmacotherapy of depressive 
      symptoms in patients who have had COVID-19. Further studies are promising its 
      effective¬ness in the treatment of post-COVID depression.

      glycoprotein S1 of SARS-CoV-2-induced NLRP3 inflammasome lung cell inflammation 
      via regulation of JAK1/STAT3 pathway: A potential anti-inflammatory compound

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The multi-systemic inflammation as a result of COVID-19 can persevere 
      long after the initial symptoms of the illness have subsided. These effects are 
      referred to as Long-COVID. Our research focused on the contribution of the Spike 
      protein S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 (Spike S1) on the lung inflammation mediated by 
      NLRP3 inflammasome machinery and the cytokine releases, interleukin 6 (IL-6), 
      IL-1beta, and IL-18, in lung epithelial cells. This study has attempted to 
      identify the naturally- occurring agents that act against inflammation-related 
      long-COVID. The seed meal of Perilla frutescens (P. frutescens), which contains 
      two major dietary polyphenols (rosmarinic acid and luteolin), has been reported 
      to exhibit anti-inflammation activities. Therefore, we have established the ethyl 
      acetate fraction of P. frutescens seed meal (PFEA) and determined its 
      anti-inflammatory effects on Spike S1 exposure in A549 lung cells. METHODS: PFEA 
      was established using solvent-partitioned extraction. Rosmarinic acid (Ra) and 
      luteolin (Lu) in PFEA were identified using the HPLC technique. The inhibitory 
      effects of PFEA and its active compounds against Spike S1-induced inflammatory 
      response in A549 cells were determined by RT-PCR and ELISA. The mechanistic study 
      of anti-inflammatory properties of PFEA and Lu were determined using western blot 
      technique. RESULTS: PFEA was found to contain Ra (388.70 ± 11.12 mg/g extract) 
      and Lu (248.82 ± 12.34 mg/g extract) as its major polyphenols. Accordingly, A549 
      lung cells were pre-treated with PFEA (12.5-100 μg/mL) and its two major 
      compounds (2.5-20 μg/mL) prior to the Spike S1 exposure at 100 ng/mL. PFEA 
      dose-dependently exhibited anti-inflammatory properties upon Spike S1-exposed 
      A549 cells through IL-6, IL-1β, IL-18, and NLRP3 gene suppressions, as well as 
      IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-18 cytokine releases with statistical significance (p < 
      0.05). Importantly, Lu possesses superior anti-inflammatory properties when 
      compared with Ra (p < 0.01). Mechanistically, PFEA and Lu effectively attenuated 
      a Spike S1-induced inflammatory response through downregulation of the 
      JAK1/STAT3-inflammasome-dependent inflammatory pathway as evidenced by the 
      downregulation of NLRP3, ASC, and cleaved-caspase-1 of the NLRP3 inflammasome 
      components and by modulating the phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT3 proteins (p < 
      0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that luteolin and PFEA can modulate the 
      signaling cascades that regulate Spike S1-induced lung inflammation during the 
      incidence of Long-COVID. Consequently, luteolin and P. frutescens may be 
      introduced as potential candidates in the preventive therapeutic strategy for 
      inflammation-related post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.

AB  - More than 700 million confirmed cases of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) have 
      been reported globally, and 10-60% of patients are expected to exhibit 
      "post-COVID-19 symptoms," which will continue to affect human life and health. In 
      the absence of safer, more specific drugs, current multiple immunotherapies have 
      failed to achieve satisfactory efficacy. Ginseng, a traditional Chinese medicine, 
      is often used as an immunomodulator and has been used in COVID-19 treatment as a 
      tonic to increase blood oxygen saturation. Ginsenosides are the main active 
      components of ginseng. In this review, we summarize the multiple ways in which 
      ginsenosides affect post-COVID-19 symptoms, including inhibition of 
      lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor signaling, modulation of chemokine 
      receptors and inflammasome activation, induction of macrophage polarization, 
      effects on Toll-like receptors, nuclear factor kappa-B, the mitogen-activated 
      protein kinase pathway, lymphocytes, intestinal flora, and epigenetic regulation. 
      Ginsenosides affect virus-mediated tissue damage, local or systemic inflammation, 
      immune modulation, and other links, thus alleviating respiratory and pulmonary 
      symptoms, reducing the cardiac burden, protecting the nervous system, and 
      providing new ideas for the rehabilitation of patients with post-COVID-19 
      symptoms. Furthermore, we analyzed its role in strengthening body resistance to 
      eliminate pathogenic factors from the perspective of ginseng-epidemic disease and 
      highlighted the challenges in clinical applications. However, the benefit of 
      ginsenosides in modulating organismal imbalance post-COVID-19 needs to be further 
      evaluated to better validate the pharmacological mechanisms associated with their 
      traditional efficacy and to determine their role in individualized therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some individuals may experience symptoms persisting for many months 
      after the recovery from COVID-19 and patients with Long COVID are managed mainly 
      with symptomatic treatment and supportive care. OBJECTIVE: This review article 
      focuses on the beneficial effects of black seeds (Nigella sativa) in the 
      management of long COVID and persistent COVID symptoms. METHODS: The literature 
      was searched in databases such as LitCOVID, Web of Science, Google Scholar, 
      bioRxiv, medRxiv, Science Direct, EBSCO, Scopus, Embase, and reference lists to 
      identify studies, which evaluated various effects of black seeds (N. sativa) 
      related to signs and symptoms of long COVID. RESULTS: Black seeds (N. sativa) 
      have shown potential anti-COVID, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, 
      immunomodulatory, antihypertensive, anti-obesity, antidiabetic, 
      antihyperlipidemic, and antiasthmatic properties in various clinical, animal, in 
      vitro, in vivo, and in silico studies, which would help the patients recovered 
      from COVID to mitigate Long COVID complications. CONCLUSION: Patients 
      experiencing Long COVID may use black seeds (N. sativa) as adjunctive therapy in 
      combination with symptomatic treatment and supportive care to prevent further 
      deterioration and hospitalization. The safety and efficacy of N. sativa in 
      patients with Long-COVID would further be established by future randomized 
      controlled clinical trials.

TI  - Early use of oral antiviral drugs and the risk of post COVID-19 syndrome: A 
      systematic review and network meta-analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the association of early use of oral 
      antiviral drugs (including nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir) with the risk 
      of post COVID-19 condition (PCC) and compare the possible efficacy of 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, 
      Cochrane, MedRxiv, and Psycinfo were searched from inception until November 1, 
      2023. We included studies that assessed the effect of oral antiviral drugs on the 
      incidence of PCC. Pairwise and network meta-analyses were conducted using a 
      random-effects model. Risk ratios (RRs) for oral antiviral drugs were calculated 
      with a confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Nine observational studies containing 
      866,066 patients were included. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir were 
      evaluated in eight and two studies respectively, with both drugs evaluated in one 
      study. Pair-wise meta-analysis showed that early oral antiviral drugs reduced PCC 
      risk (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68-0.88). Network meta-analysis showed that 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may perform better than molnupiravir (surface under the 
      cumulative ranking curve: 95.5% vs. 31.6%) at reducing PCC risk. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Early use of oral antiviral drugs may potentially protect against developing PCC 
      in non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19. These findings support the 
      standardized administration of oral antiviral drugs in patients during the acute 
      phase of COVID-19 according to the guidelines.

AB  - PURPOSE: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused many 
      children to stay indoors. Increased near work and insufficient outdoor activities 
      are considered important risk factors for myopic progression. This study aimed to 
      compare the changes in myopic progression before and after COVID-19 in children 
      treated with low-concentration atropine. METHODS: The records of 103 eyes of 103 
      children who were treated with low-concentration atropine eye drops were 
      retrospectively reviewed. We classified children according to the concentration 
      of atropine eye drops and children's age. The beginning of the pre-COVID-19 
      period was set from January 2019 to May 2019, and the endpoint was set in March 
      2020. The beginning of the post-COVID-19 period was set in March 2020, and the 
      endpoint was set from January 2021 to March 2021. We evaluated the questionnaires 
      administered to children's parents. RESULTS: A significant myopic progression was 
      observed in the post-COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period in the 
      0.05% and 0.025% atropine groups (P < 0.001 and P = 0.020, respectively). For 
      children aged 5 to 7 and 8 to 10 years, the axial elongations were significantly 
      faster in the post-COVID-19 period than in the pre-COVID-19 period (P = 0.022 and 
      P = 0.005, respectively). However, the rates of axial elongation and myopic 
      progression were not significantly different between pre- and post-COVID-19 in 
      children aged 11 to 15 years (P = 0.065 and P = 0.792, respectively). The average 
      time spent using computers and smartphones and reading time were significantly 
      increased, and the times of physical and outdoor activity were significantly 
      decreased in the post-COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The rates of myopic progression have increased substantially after 
      the spread of COVID-19 with an increase in the home confinement of children. 
      Therefore, it is necessary to control the environmental risk factors for myopia, 
      even in children undergoing treatment for the inhibition of myopic progression.

AB  - The duration and severity of COVID-19 are related to age, comorbidities, and 
      cytokine synthesis. This study evaluated the impact of these factors on patients 
      with clinical presentations of COVID-19 in a Brazilian cohort. A total of 317 
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included; cases were distributed according 
      to clinical status as severe (n=91), moderate (n=56) and mild (n=170). Of these 
      patients, 92 had acute COVID-19 at sample collection, 90 had already recovered 
      from COVID-19 without sequelae, and 135 had sequelae (long COVID syndrome). In 
      the acute COVID-19 group, patients with the severe form had higher IL-6 levels 
      (p=0.0260). In the post-COVID-19 group, there was no significant difference in 
      cytokine levels between groups with different clinical conditions. In the acute 
      COVID-19 group, younger patients had higher levels of TNF-α, and patients without 
      comorbidities had higher levels of TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-2 (p<0.05). In contrast, 
      patients over age 60 with comorbidities had higher levels of IL-6. In the 
      post-COVID-19 group, subjects with long COVID-19 had higher levels of IL-17 and 
      IL-2 (p<0.05), and subjects without sequelae had higher levels of IL-10, IL-6 and 
      IL- 4 (p<0.05). Our results suggest that advanced age, comorbidities and elevated 
      serum IL-6 levels are associated with severe COVID-19 and are good markers to 
      differentiate severe from mild cases. Furthermore, high serum levels of IL-17 and 
      IL-2 and low levels of IL-4 and IL-10 appear to constitute a cytokine profile of 
      long COVID-19, and these markers are potential targets for COVID-19 treatment and 
      prevention strategies.

TI  - The Efficacy of Multivitamin, Vitamin A, Vitamin B, Vitamin C, and Vitamin D 
      Supplements in the Prevention and Management of COVID-19 and Long-COVID: An 
      Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.

AB  - This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of any vitamin administration(s) in 
      preventing and managing COVID-19 and/or long-COVID. Databases were searched up to 
      May 2023 to identify randomized clinical trials comparing data on the effects of 
      vitamin supplementation(s) versus placebo or standard of care on the two 
      conditions of interest. Inverse-variance random-effects meta-analyses were 
      conducted to estimate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
      for all-cause mortality between supplemented and non-supplemented individuals. 
      Overall, 37 articles were included: two regarded COVID-19 and long-COVID 
      prevention and 35 records the COVID-19 management. The effects of vitamin D in 
      preventing COVID-19 and long-COVID were contrasting. Similarly, no conclusion 
      could be drawn on the efficacy of multivitamins, vitamin A, and vitamin B in 
      COVID-19 management. A few positive findings were reported in some vitamin C 
      trials but results were inconsistent in most outcomes, excluding all-cause 
      mortality (RR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.72-0.97). Vitamin D results were mixed in most 
      aspects, including mortality, in which benefits were observed in regular 
      administrations only (RR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.49-0.91). Despite some benefits, 
      results were mostly contradictory. Variety in recruitment and treatment protocols 
      might explain this heterogeneity. Better-designed studies are needed to clarify 
      these vitamins' potential effects against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - COVID-19 infection has been a key threat to the public health system globally, 
      with an estimated 248 million cases worldwide. COVID-19 patients are subject to a 
      higher risk of developing chronic respiratory disorders that are closely 
      associated with long-term disability, multi-morbidity, and premature mortality. 
      Although there have been recent advancements in respiratory treatment regimens, 
      there has also been increased interest in the use of medicinal mushrooms in 
      bridging the unaddressed pathways of action within the treatment algorithms. In 
      this review, we provide a collection of medicinal mushrooms that are beneficial 
      in promoting respiratory health and potentially reducing COVID-19 symptoms in 
      patients who are newly diagnosed and those who have recovered. While reviewing 
      the use of immunomodulatory pathways, which have shown promising results in 
      tackling side effects and post-COVID syndromes, we also provide insights into how 
      the antioxidant elements present in medicinal mushrooms help to achieve the same 
      results, especially in the prophylactic and therapeutic management of COVID-19 
      infection. To date, medicinal mushrooms are regarded as a functional food, which, 
      however, need further quality, safety, and efficacy assessments. These 
      requirements are also highlighted in the present review to promote the future 
      development and application of medicinal mushrooms for better respiratory health.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative 
      agent of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is deeply 
      affecting the whole world. In this new case for the scientific world, scientists 
      are investigating the etiopathogenesis of viral infection-induced damage and have 
      started to focus on the short and long-term immune system effects and alterations 
      after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The case is here reported of a 53-year-old female 
      patient with acute monoarthritis after SARS-CoV-2 infection, who responded 
      adequately to 150 mg/day diclofenac treatment, and the available case reports are 
      comprehensively reviewed. With the focus on arthritis after SARS-CoV2 infection, 
      which emerges as a new pathological condition associated with COVID-19, it was 
      aimed to examine the possible immunological mechanisms of post-COVID-19 arthritis 
      based on the current data on SARS-CoV-2 and the known pathogenetic background of 
      viral arthritis.

TI  - Indomethacin for refractory COVID or post-COVID headache: a retrospective study.
PG  - 465-469
LID - 10.1007/s13760-021-01790-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, manifests with headache, 
      both in the acute phase and as a post-infection symptom, which may be refractory 
      to usual analgesics. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the therapeutic response of 
      refractory COVID or post-COVID headache to indomethacin. METHODS: This was an 
      observational, retrospective, open and uncontrolled. A sample of 37 patients 
      diagnosed with COVID-19 presenting headache during the acute phase or after the 
      resolution of the disease, with refractoriness to the usual symptomatic 
      medication was treated with indomethacin. RESULTS: Of the 37 patients (24 women 
      and 13 men), 29 were migraineurs and 8 had no previous history of headache. The 
      average age was 40.4 ± 9.4 years, ranging from 19 to 65 years. In 26 (70.3%) 
      patients, the onset of headache occurred within 72 h, and in 11 (29.7%), after 
      10 days of positivity for Sars-CoV-2. After treatment with indomethacin, 36 
      patients reported greater than 50% headache relief from the third day and 5 
      became asymptomatic on the fifth day. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with migraine or 
      no prior history of headache who present with refractory COVID or post-COVID 
      headache to common analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and/or triptans, 
      indomethacin should be considered a therapeutic option.

AB  - COVID-19 is characterised by a broad spectrum of clinical and pathological 
      features. Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in innate immune 
      responses to viral infections. Here, we analysed the phenotype and activity of NK 
      cells in the blood of COVID-19 patients using flow cytometry, single-cell 
      RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and a cytotoxic killing assay. In the plasma of 
      patients, we quantified the main cytokines and chemokines. Our cohort comprises 
      COVID-19 patients hospitalised in a low-care ward unit (WARD), patients with 
      severe COVID-19 disease symptoms hospitalised in intensive care units (ICU), and 
      post-COVID-19 patients, who were discharged from hospital six weeks earlier. NK 
      cells from hospitalised COVID-19 patients displayed an activated phenotype with 
      substantial differences between WARD and ICU patients and the timing when samples 
      were taken post-onset of symptoms. While NK cells from COVID-19 patients at an 
      early stage of infection showed increased expression of the cytotoxic molecules 
      perforin and granzyme A and B, NK cells from patients at later stages of COVID-19 
      presented enhanced levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α which were measured ex vivo in the 
      absence of usual in vitro stimulation. These activated NK cells were phenotyped 
      as CD49a(+)CD69a(+)CD107a(+) cells, and their emergence in patients correlated to 
      the number of neutrophils, and plasma IL-15, a key cytokine in NK cell 
      activation. Despite lower amounts of cytotoxic molecules in NK cells of patients 
      with severe symptoms, majority of COVID-19 patients displayed a normal cytotoxic 
      killing of Raji tumour target cells. In vitro stimulation of patients blood cells 
      by IL-12+IL-18 revealed a defective IFN-γ production in NK cells of ICU patients 
      only, indicative of an exhausted phenotype. ScRNA-seq revealed, predominantly in 
      patients with severe COVID-19 disease symptoms, the emergence of an NK cell 
      subset with a platelet gene signature that we identified by flow and imaging 
      cytometry as aggregates of NK cells with CD42a(+)CD62P(+) activated platelets. 
      Post-COVID-19 patients show slow recovery of NK cell frequencies and phenotype. 
      Our study points to substantial changes in NK cell phenotype during COVID-19 
      disease and forms a basis to explore the contribution of platelet-NK cell 
      aggregates to antiviral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and disease pathology.

LID - e238419
AB  - Sudden onset sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is frequently seen by 
      otolaryngologists. The exact pathophysiology of the disease is still unknown, 
      with the most likely causative factor being following a viral infection. 
      Immediate steroids are the best treatment to improve prognosis. Despite a 
      plethora of papers in the literature describing SSNHL, there are only a few 
      reported cases of hearing loss following COVID-19, none of which have been 
      reported in the UK. This paper presents the first UK case of SSNHL following 
      COVID-19. Physical examination and imaging excluded any other cause of hearing 
      loss. A literature review showed that four other cases have been previously 
      described. Hearing loss can be a significant cause of morbidity and can easily be 
      missed in the intensive care setting. Being aware and screening for SSNHL 
      following COVID-19 enables an early course of steroids, which offers the best 
      chance of recovering hearing.

TI  - Opioid use and COVID-19: a secondary analysis of the impact of relaxation of 
      methadone take-home dosing guidelines on use of illicit opioids.
PG  - 597-605
LID - 10.1080/00952990.2023.2222336 [doi]
AB  - Background: An exemption to existing U.S. regulation of methadone maintenance 
      therapy after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic permitted increased take-home 
      doses beginning March 2020.Objectives: We assessed the impact of this exemption 
      on opioid use.Methods: A pre/post study of 187 clients recruited from an OTP who 
      completed a survey and consented to share their urine drug testing (UDT) data. 
      Use of fentanyl, morphine, hydromorphone, codeine, and heroin was assessed via 
      UDT. Receipt of take-home methadone doses was assessed from clinic records for 
      142 working days pre- and post-COVID exemption. Analysis was conducted using a 
      linear regression model to assess the association between increased take-home 
      doses and use of illicit opioids.Results: In the pre- vs. post-COVID-19 SAMHSA 
      exemption periods, 26.2% vs. 36.3% of UDTs were positive for 6-acetylmorphine 
      respectively, 32.6% vs. 40.6% positive for codeine, 34.2% vs 44.2% positive for 
      hydromorphone, 39.5% vs. 48.1% positive for morphine, 8.0% vs. 14.4% positive for 
      fentanyl (p-value < .001). However, in the unadjusted descriptive data, when 
      grouped by change in substance use, those clients who experienced a decrease in 
      the use of morphine, codeine, and heroin post-COVID-19 were given significantly 
      more take-home doses than the groups that had no change or an increase in the use 
      of these substances. In the adjusted model, there was no significant relationship 
      between change in opioid use and increased receipt of take-home methadone 
      doses.Conclusions: Although take-home doses post-COVID-19 nearly doubled, this 
      increase was not associated with a significant change in use of illicit opioids.

AB  - There is an urgent need to have reliable technologies to diagnose 
      post-coronavirus disease syndrome (PCS), as the number of people affected by 
      COVID-19 and related complications is increasing worldwide. Considering the 
      amount of risks associated with the two chronic lung diseases, asthma and chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), there is an immediate requirement for a 
      screening method for PCS, which also produce symptoms similar to these 
      conditions, especially since very often, many COVID-19 cases remain undetected 
      because a good share of such patients is asymptomatic. Breath analysis techniques 
      are getting attention since they are highly non-invasive methods for disease 
      diagnosis, can be implemented easily for point-of-care applications even in 
      primary health care centres. Electronic (E-) nose technology is coming up with 
      better reliability, ease of operation, and affordability to all, and it can 
      generate signatures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath as 
      markers of diseases. The present report is an outcome of a pilot study using an 
      E-nose device on breath samples of cohorts of PCS, asthma, and normal (control) 
      subjects. Match/no-match and k-NN analysis tests have been carried out to confirm 
      the diagnosis of PCS. The prediction model has given 100% sensitivity and 
      specificity. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) has been plotted for the 
      prediction model, and the area under the curve (AUC) is obtained as 1. The E-nose 
      technique is found to be working well for PCS diagnosis. Our study suggests that 
      the breath analysis using E-nose can be used as a point-of-care diagnosis of 
      PCS.Trial registrationBreath samples were collected from the Kasturba Hospital, 
      Manipal. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee, 
      Kasturba Medical College, Manipal (IEC 60/2021, 13/01/2021) and Indian Council of 
      Medical Research (ICMR) (CTRI/2021/02/031357, 06/02/2021) Government of India; 
      trials were prospectively registered.

TI  - Pharmacovigilance study of amphotericin B for mucormycosis in post-COVID and 
      non-COVID patients at a tertiary care hospital in Eastern India.
PG  - 417-422
LID - 10.4103/ijp.ijp_474_22 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mucormycosis is a rare but serious fungal infection which has 
      dramatically increased in post-COVID patients. There is a paucity of safety data 
      on amphotericin B (amphoB) used for mucormycosis treatment. OBJECTIVES: The 
      objective of this prospective, observational, active safety surveillance study 
      was to evaluate the safety profile of amphoB in a cohort of hospitalized patients 
      who were on the drug for suspected mucormycosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 
      suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in hospitalized mucormycosis patients who 
      had received amphoB were analyzed. The nature, severity, outcome of the ADRs were 
      recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 77 patients enrolled, 70% had documented 
      history of prior COVID-19 infection. 96% had comorbidities, the most common being 
      diabetes. Majority received conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate formulation. 
      97% experienced at least one suspected ADR and the median ADR/patient was 3. Out 
      of 214 ADRs, 91 were serious but there were no ADR-related deaths. The most 
      common ADRs were hypokalemia (31.78%), infusion-related reactions (22.43%), and 
      anemia (17.29%). Thirty-three patients had serum potassium <2.5 mEq/L, while 11 
      had serum magnesium <1.25 mg/dL. Doubling of pretreatment creatinine level was 
      noted in 15 patients. Seventy percent ADRs were of "possible" category as per the 
      World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Centre categorization. CONCLUSION: 
      AmphoB deoxycholate use in mucormycosis patients was associated with a high 
      incidence of electrolyte abnormalities and infusion-related reactions. All ADRs 
      subsided with medical management and none were fatal. The safety data generated 
      from this study may be useful in resource-limited settings where the far more 
      expensive liposomal formulation is not being used.

TI  - Selenium Status and Oxidative Stress in SARS-CoV-2 Patients.
LID - 10.3390/medicina59030527 [doi]
LID - 527
AB  - Background and Objectives: Insufficient intake of essential micronutrient 
      selenium (Se) increases the susceptibility to diseases associated with oxidative 
      stress. The study aim was to assess Se status and oxidative stress in COVID-19 
      patients depending on severity of the disease. Materials and Methods: Blood 
      plasma of 80 post-COVID-19 disease patients and 40 acutely ill patients were 
      investigated. Concentration of Se was detected by a fluorometric method with 
      di-amino-naphthalene using acidic hydrolysis. Selenoprotein P (Sepp1), 
      malondialdehyde (MDA), and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and their metabolite adducts 
      were evaluated by spectrophotometric methods using commercial assay kits. 
      Results: Obtained results demonstrated that Se and Sepp1 concentration in acute 
      patients were significantly (p < 0.05 for Se and p < 0.001 for Sepp1) decreased 
      compared with post-COVID-19 disease patients. However, in post-COVID-19 disease 
      patients, Se values were close to the low limit of the norm for the European 
      population. 4-HNE adducts concentration as a marker of lipid peroxidation was 
      significantly increased in the acute patients group compared to the recovery 
      group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: COVID-19 pathology is characterized by the 
      induction of oxidative stress and suppression of antioxidant defenses during the 
      acute phase. Lower levels of Se and Sepp1 and higher levels of reactive oxygen 
      species reflect this imbalance, highlighting the role of oxidative stress in the 
      disease's pathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Loss of olfactory function is well recognised as a cardinal symptom 
      of COVID-19 infection, and the ongoing pandemic has resulted in a large number of 
      affected individuals with abnormalities in their sense of smell. For many, the 
      condition is temporary and resolves within two to four weeks. However, in a 
      significant minority the symptoms persist. At present, it is not known whether 
      early intervention with any form of treatment (such as medication or olfactory 
      training) can promote recovery and prevent persisting olfactory disturbance.  
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions that have 
      been used, or proposed, to prevent persisting olfactory dysfunction due to 
      COVID-19 infection. A secondary objective is to keep the evidence up-to-date, 
      using a living systematic review approach.  SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT 
      Information Specialist searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register; Cochrane 
      ENT Register; CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; 
      ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished 
      studies. The date of the search was 16 December 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: 
      Randomised controlled trials including participants who had symptoms of olfactory 
      disturbance following COVID-19 infection. Individuals who had symptoms for less 
      than four weeks were included in this review. Studies compared any intervention 
      with no treatment or placebo.  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard 
      Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were the presence of 
      normal olfactory function, serious adverse effects and change in sense of smell. 
      Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of parosmia, change in sense of taste, 
      disease-related quality of life and other adverse effects (including 
      nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the 
      evidence for each outcome.  MAIN RESULTS: We included one study of 100 
      participants, which compared an intranasal steroid spray to no intervention. 
      Participants in both groups were also advised to undertake olfactory training for 
      the duration of the trial. Data were identified for only two of the prespecified 
      outcomes for this review, and no data were available for the primary outcome of 
      serious adverse effects. Intranasal corticosteroids compared to no intervention 
      (all using olfactory training) Presence of normal olfactory function after three 
      weeks of treatment was self-assessed by the participants, using a visual analogue 
      scale (range 0 to 10, higher scores = better). A score of 10 represented 
      "completely normal smell sensation". The evidence is very uncertain about the 
      effect of intranasal corticosteroids on self-rated recovery of sense of smell 
      (estimated absolute effect 619 per 1000 compared to 520 per 1000, risk ratio (RR) 
      1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.68; 1 study; 100 participants; very 
      low-certainty evidence).  Change in sense of smell was not reported, but the 
      self-rated score for sense of smell was reported at the endpoint of the study 
      with the same visual analogue scale (after three weeks of treatment). The median 
      scores at endpoint were 10 (interquartile range (IQR) 9 to 10) for the group 
      receiving intranasal corticosteroids, and 10 (IQR 5 to 10) for the group 
      receiving no intervention (1 study; 100 participants; very low-certainty 
      evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very limited evidence regarding the 
      efficacy of different interventions at preventing persistent olfactory 
      dysfunction following COVID-19 infection. However, we have identified a small 
      number of additional ongoing studies in this area. As this is a living systematic 
      review, the evidence will be updated regularly to incorporate new data from 
      these, and other relevant studies, as they become available.  For this (first) 
      version of the living review, we identified a single study of intranasal 
      corticosteroids to include in this review, which provided data for only two of 
      our prespecified outcomes. The evidence was of very low certainty, therefore we 
      were unable to determine whether intranasal corticosteroids may have a beneficial 
      or harmful effect.

AB  - COVID-19 infection causes complications, even in people who have had a mild 
      course of the disease. The most dangerous seem to be neurological ailments: 
      anxiety, depression, mixed anxiety-depressive (MAD) syndromes, and irreversible 
      dementia. These conditions can negatively affect the respiratory system, 
      circulatory system, and heart functioning. We believe that phytotherapy can be 
      helpful in all of these conditions. Clinical trials confirm this possibility. The 
      work presents plant materials (Valeriana officinalis, Melissa officinalis, 
      Passiflora incarnata, Piper methysticum, Humulus lupulus, Ballota nigra, 
      Hypericum perforatum, Rhodiola rosea, Lavandula officinalis, Paullinia cupana, 
      Ginkgo biloba, Murraya koenigii, Crataegus monogyna and oxyacantha, Hedera helix, 
      Polygala senega, Pelargonium sidoides, Lichen islandicus, Plantago lanceolata) 
      and their dominant compounds (valeranon, valtrate, apigenin, citronellal, 
      isovitexin, isoorientin, methysticin, humulone, farnesene, acteoside, hypericin, 
      hyperforin, biapigenin, rosavidin, salidroside, linalool acetate, linalool,

      fumaroprotocetric acid, protolichesteric acid, aucubin, acteoside) responsible 
      for their activity. It also shows the possibility of reducing post-COVID-19 
      neurological, respiratory, and cardiovascular complications, which can affect the 
      functioning of the nervous system.

AB  - There have been 774,075,242 cases of COVID-19 and 7,012,986 deaths worldwide as 
      of January 2024. In the early stages of the pandemic, there was an urgent need to 
      reduce the severity of the disease and prevent the need for hospitalization to 
      avoid stress on healthcare systems worldwide. The repurposing of drugs to prevent 
      clinical deterioration of COVID-19 patients was trialed in many studies using 
      many different drugs. Fluvoxamine (an SSRI and sigma-1 receptor agonist) was 
      initially identified to potentially provide beneficial effects in 
      COVID-19-infected patients, preventing clinical deterioration and the need for 
      hospitalization. Fourteen clinical studies have been carried out to date, with 
      seven of those being randomized placebo-controlled studies. This systematic 
      review and meta-analysis covers the literature from the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 
      late 2019 until January 2024. Search terms related to fluvoxamine, such as its 
      trade names and chemical names, along with words related to COVID-19, such as 
      SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus, were used in literature databases including PubMed, 
      Google Scholar, Scopus, and the ClinicalTrials.gov database from NIH, to identify 
      the trials used in the subsequent analysis. Clinical deterioration and death data 
      were extracted from these studies where available and used in the meta-analysis. 
      A total of 7153 patients were studied across 14 studies (both open-label and 
      double-blind placebo-controlled). 681 out of 3553 (19.17%) in the standard care 
      group and 255 out of 3600 (7.08%) in the fluvoxamine-treated group experienced 
      clinical deterioration. The estimated average log odds ratio was 1.087 (95% CI 
      0.200 to 1.973), which differed significantly from zero (z = 2.402, p = 0.016). 
      The seven placebo-controlled studies resulted in a log odds ratio of 0.359 (95% 
      CI 0.1111 to 0.5294), which differed significantly from zero (z = 3.103, 
      p = 0.002). The results of this study identified fluvoxamine as effective in 
      preventing clinical deterioration, and subgrouping analysis suggests that earlier 
      treatment with a dose of 200 mg or above provides the best outcomes. We hope the 
      outcomes of this study can help design future studies into respiratory viral 
      infections and potentially improve clinical outcomes.

AB  - This review describes our current understanding of the role of the mitochondria 
      in the repurposing of the anti-diabetes drugs metformin, gliclazide, GLP-1 
      receptor agonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors for additional clinical benefits 
      regarding unhealthy aging, long COVID, mental neurogenerative disorders, and 
      obesity. Metformin, the most prominent of these diabetes drugs, has been called 
      the "Drug of Miracles and Wonders," as clinical trials have found it to be 
      beneficial for human patients suffering from these maladies. To promote viral 
      replication in all infected human cells, SARS-CoV-2 stimulates the infected liver 
      cells to produce glucose and to export it into the blood stream, which can cause 
      diabetes in long COVID patients, and metformin, which reduces the levels of 
      glucose in the blood, was shown to cut the incidence rate of long COVID in half 
      for all patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2. Metformin leads to the 
      phosphorylation of the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK, which accelerates the 
      import of glucose into cells via the glucose transporter GLUT4 and switches the 
      cells to the starvation mode, counteracting the virus. Diabetes drugs also 
      stimulate the unfolded protein response and thus mitophagy, which is beneficial 
      for healthy aging and mental health. Diabetes drugs were also found to mimic 
      exercise and help to reduce body weight.

AB  - Asthenia, asthenic syndrome, asthenic condition, asthenic reaction, asthenic 
      disorders are terms that describe the state of «impotence». Fatigue that occurs 
      against the background of habitual physical or intellectual stress for a person, 
      and persists after rest, is asthenia. For people of the older age group, the term 
      senile asthenia syndrome is used. Asthenia manifests itself with increased 
      fatigue and exhaustion, mood instability, increased irritability, sleep 
      disorders. Asthenic conditions manifest themselves along with a decrease in 
      physical activity, increased cognitive and mental fatigue. Asthenic syndrome (AS) 
      are considered as an integral part of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), as one of 
      the manifestations of cerebrovascular pathology. Senile asthenia syndrome (SAS) 
      is a geriatric syndrome characterized by an age-associated decrease in the 
      physiological reserve and functions of many body systems, including cognitive 
      functions. One of the drugs that has a positive effect on the severity of AS and 
      improves the state of cognitive functions is the domestic drug Recognan 
      (citicoline). The effectiveness of Recognan in the treatment of AS in patients 
      with CVD, SAS, and post-COVID asthenia has been shown. It is recommended to 
      prescribe Recognan orally at 500 mg / day for 30 days. Recognan has a nootropic 
      and antiasthenic effect.

TI  - Endoscopic Features of Post-COVID-19 Cholangiopathy and Its Management Using 
      ERCP.
PG  - 748-759
LID - 10.14309/ajg.0000000000002562 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite growing awareness of post-coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) cholangiopathy as one of the most serious long-term gastrointestinal 
      consequences of COVID-19, the endoscopic features of this disease are still 
      poorly characterized. This study aimed to more precisely define its endoscopic 
      features and to outline the role of endoscopic retrograde 
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the management of this entity. METHODS: In 
      this observational study, 46 patients with confirmed post-COVID-19 cholangiopathy 
      were included. RESULTS: Based on the endoscopic features observed in 141 ERCP 
      procedures, post-COVID-19 cholangiopathy can be classified as a variant of 
      secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients. It appeared early in 
      the course of intensive care treatment of patients with COVID-19 (cholestasis 
      onset 4.5 days after intubation, median). This form of cholangiopathy was more 
      destructive than stricturing in nature and caused irreversible damage to the bile 
      ducts. A centripetal pattern of intrahepatic bile duct destruction, the 
      phenomenon of vanishing bile ducts, the absence of extrahepatic involvement, and 
      the presence of intraductal biliary casts (85% of patients) were typical 
      cholangiographic features of post-COVID-19 cholangiopathy. This cholangiopathy 
      was often complicated by small peribiliary liver abscesses with isolation of 
      Enterococcus faecium and Candida spp. in bile culture. The prognosis was dismal, 
      with a 1-year liver transplantation-free survival rate of 44%. In particular, 
      patients with peribiliary liver abscesses or destruction of the central bile 
      ducts tended to have a poor prognosis (n.s.). As shown by multivariate analysis, 
      bilirubin levels (on intensive care unit day 25-36) negatively correlated with 
      liver transplantation-free survival (hazard ratio 1.08, P < 0.001). 
      Interventional endoscopy with cast removal had a positive effect on cholestasis 
      parameters (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin); 
      approximately 60% of all individual values decreased. DISCUSSION: 
      Gastrointestinal endoscopy makes an important contribution to the management of 
      post-COVID-19 cholangiopathy. ERCP is not only of great diagnostic and prognostic 
      value but also has therapeutic value and therefore remains indispensable.

TI  - Antibiotic Consumption During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic and Emergence 
      of Carbapenemase-Producing Klebsiella pneumoniae Lineages Among Inpatients in a 
      Chilean Hospital: A Time-Series Study and Phylogenomic Analysis.
PG  - S20-S28

AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on antimicrobial 
      use (AU) and resistance has not been well evaluated in South America. These data 
      are critical to inform national policies and clinical care. METHODS: At a 
      tertiary hospital in Santiago, Chile, between 2018 and 2022, subdivided into pre- 
      (3/2018-2/2020) and post-COVID-19 onset (3/2020-2/2022), we evaluated intravenous 
      AU and frequency of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE). We grouped 
      monthly AU (defined daily doses [DDD]/1000 patient-days) into broad-spectrum 
      β-lactams, carbapenems, and colistin and used interrupted time-series analysis to 
      compare AU during pre- and post-pandemic onset. We studied the frequency of 
      carbapenemase-producing (CP) CRE and performed whole-genome sequencing analyses 
      of all carbapenem-resistant (CR) Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKpn) isolates collected 
      during the study period. RESULTS: Compared with pre-pandemic, AU (DDD/1000 
      patient-days) significantly increased after the pandemic onset, from 78.1 to 
      142.5 (P < .001), 50.9 to 110.1 (P < .001), and 4.1 to 13.3 (P < .001) for 
      broad-spectrum β-lactams, carbapenems, and colistin, respectively. The frequency 
      of CP-CRE increased from 12.8% pre-COVID-19 to 51.9% after pandemic onset (P < 
      .001). The most frequent CRE species in both periods was CRKpn (79.5% and 76.5%, 
      respectively). The expansion of CP-CRE harboring blaNDM was particularly 
      noticeable, increasing from 40% (n = 4/10) before to 73.6% (n = 39/53) after 
      pandemic onset (P < .001). Our phylogenomic analyses revealed the emergence of 
      two distinct genomic lineages of CP-CRKpn: ST45, harboring blaNDM, and ST1161, 
      which carried blaKPC. CONCLUSIONS: AU and the frequency of CP-CRE increased after 
      COVID-19 onset. The increase in CP-CRKpn was driven by the emergence of novel 
      genomic lineages. Our observations highlight the need to strengthen infection 
      prevention and control and antimicrobial stewardship efforts.

TI  - Pityriasis Rosea after COVID-19 Infection.
PG  - 265-266
AB  - Dear Editor, Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a common, self-limited erythematous 
      papulosquamous dermatosis that mainly affects young adults. It is believed to 
      represent a delayed reaction to viral infections and is usually associated with 
      endogenous systemic reactivation of human herpesvirus (HHV) 6 and / or 7 (1). A 
      46-year-old man presented to our Department with a two-week history of skin rash 
      associated with mild pruritus. He described the appearance of an erythematous 
      centrally scaled lesion at the right part of his abdomen, followed by the 
      spreading of red oval mildly scaling lesions on the trunk, neck, and proximal 
      parts of the upper extremities, which showed in the physical examination (Figure 
      1, a and b). He was otherwise healthy and taking no medications. Six weeks prior 
      to the appearance of the initial skin lesion, the patient had coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) infection with mild clinical presentation (fever up to 38 °C 
      lasting for four days and mild headache) and with symptoms of post COVID-19 
      syndrome (excessive tiredness). He denied oropharyngeal lesions. Potassium 
      hydroxide, syphilis, and laboratory tests were within normal limits. Within two 
      weeks of topical betamethasone dipropionate treatment, the lesions disappeared 
      completely. In addition to reactivation of HHV-6 or HHV-7, PR can be triggered by 
      some drugs (like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors alone or in combination 
      with hydrochlorothiazide, sartans plus hydrochlorothiazide, allopurinol, 
      nimesulide, and acetyl salicylic acid (2) and vaccines (such as smallpox, 
      poliomyelitis, influenza, human papillomavirus, diphtheria, tuberculosis, 
      hepatitis B, pneumococcus, and yellow fever vaccines) (3). There is a growing 
      number of published cases that link PR to COVID-19 infection, with PR appearing 
      either in the acute phase of COVID-19 or, as in our patient, in the post COVID-19 
      period (4-9). Unlike in our patient, oropharyngeal lesions were observed in 
      approximately 16% of patients with typical PR (10). It has been suggested that 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces reactivation 
      of other viruses, such as HHV-6, HHV-7, varicella zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr 
      virus (5). PR has also been reported to follow COVID-19 vaccination (11). As our 
      patient did not receive a COVID-19 vaccine, we cannot evaluate the latter based 
      on the present case. We speculate that PR could be a delayed skin manifestation 
      of COVID-19 infection, triggered either by SARS-CoV-2 immediately or indirectly 
      by the reactivation of other viruses such as HHV-6 or HHV-7. However, the 
      etiopathogenetic mechanisms remain largely unknown and further studies are needed 
      in order to clarify the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 and PR.

TI  - Natural and Semi-Synthetic Flavonoid Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Agents for the Treatment of 
      Long COVID-19 Disease and Neurodegenerative Disorders of Cognitive Decline.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.31083/j.fbe1404027 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this review is to highlight the beneficial attributes of flavonoids, a 
      diverse family of widely-distributed polyphenolic phytochemicals that have 
      beneficial cell and tissue protective properties. Phytochemicals are widely 
      distributed in plants, herbs and shrubs used in traditional complimentary medical 
      formulations for centuries. The bioactive components that convey beneficial 
      medicinal effects in these complex herbal preparations are now being identified 
      using network pharmacology and molecular docking procedures that identify their 
      molecular targets. Flavonoids have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, 
      antibacterial and anti-cancer properties that have inspired the development of 
      potent multifunctional derivatised flavonoids of improved efficacy. The antiviral 
      properties of flavonoids and the emergence of the severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in a resurgence of interest in 
      phytochemicals in the search for efficacious compounds that can prevent viral 
      infection or replication, with many promising plant compounds identified. 
      Promising semi-synthetic flavonoid derivatives have also been developed that 
      inhibit multiple pathological neurodegenerative processes; these offer 
      considerable promise in the treatment of diseases of cognitive decline. Clinical 
      trials are currently being undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of dietary 
      supplements rich in flavonoids for the treatment of virally-mediated diseases. 
      Such trials are expected to identify flavonoids with cell and tissue protective 
      properties that can be harnessed in biomedical applications that may serve as 
      supportive adjunctive procedures to conventional anti-viral drug therapies 
      against diseases such as COVID-19.

AB  - Infection with SARS-CoV2 leads to COVID-19, the severity of which derives from 
      the host’s immune response, especially the release of a storm of pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines. This coronavirus infects by first binding to the ectoenzyme 
      Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a serine protease acting as the receptor, 
      while another serine protease is necessary for priming the viral spike “S” 
      protein required for entering the cells. Repurposing existing drugs for potential 
      anti-coronavirus activity have failed. As a result, there were intense efforts to 
      rapidly produce ways of providing prophylactic active immunization (vaccines) or 
      abortive passive (convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies) neutralizing 
      antibodies. The availability of vaccines for COVID-19 have been largely 
      successful, but many questions still remain unanswered. In spite of the original 
      enthusiasm, clinical studies using convalescent serum or monoclonal antibodies 
      have shown limited benefit. Moreover, the emergence of Long-COVID syndrome in 
      most infected patients necessitates the development of treatment approaches that 
      may prevent viral entry by blocking both serine proteases involved, as with a 
      liposomal blend of the natural flavonoids luteolin and quercetin.

AB  - Since April 2024, a pertussis epidemic has been ongoing in Finland with 2,215 
      notified cases by end October. Of them, 30.1% (n = 667) were aged 10-14 years. Of 
      the 462 Bordetella pertussis isolates characterised, one was macrolide-resistant 
      (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of erythromycin, azithromycin and 
      clarithromycin > 256 μg/mL). The resistant isolate was serotype FIM2, vaccine 
      antigen pertactin-deficient and harboured ptxP3 allele. The emergence of 
      macrolide-resistant B. pertussis in Europe is worrisome and its rapid 
      identification is important.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been associated with olfactory dysfunction in many 
      infected patients. The rise of calcium levels in the nasal secretions plays an 
      essential role in the olfaction process with a desensitization effect on the 
      olfactory receptor neurons and a negative impact on the olfaction transmission. 
      Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) is a chelating agent that can bind free 
      calcium in the nasal secretions, thereby reducing the adverse effects of calcium 
      on olfactory function. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work is to demonstrate 
      the effect of intranasal EDTA on improving olfactory dysfunction following 
      COVID-19. METHODS: Fifty patients with a history of COVID-19 and olfactory 
      dysfunction that persisted for more than 6 months were enrolled in the current 
      prospective randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomized into 2 equal 
      groups. Twenty-five patients were treated with olfactory training only, while the 
      remaining 25 patients received treatment with olfactory training and a topical 
      nasal spray of ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid. The olfactory function was 
      assessed before treatment and 3 months later using the Sniffin' Sticks test. 
      Additionally, the determination of calcium level in the nasal secretions was 
      performed using an ion-selective electrode before treatment and 3 months later. 
      RESULTS: Eighty-eight percent of the patients treated with olfactory training in 
      addition to EDTA exhibited clinical improvement, while 60% showed improvement in 
      patients treated with olfactory training only. Furthermore, a significant 
      decrease in the measured calcium level in the nasal secretions was demonstrated 
      after the use of ethylene diamine tetra compared to patients treated with 
      olfactory training only. CONCLUSION: Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid may be 
      associated with an improvement of the olfactory function post-COVID-19.

TI  - Role of Creatine Supplementation in Conditions Involving Mitochondrial 
      Dysfunction: A Narrative Review.
LID - 10.3390/nu14030529 [doi]
LID - 529
AB  - Creatine monohydrate (CrM) is one of the most widely used nutritional supplements 
      among active individuals and athletes to improve high-intensity exercise 
      performance and training adaptations. However, research suggests that CrM 
      supplementation may also serve as a therapeutic tool in the management of some 
      chronic and traumatic diseases. Creatine supplementation has been reported to 
      improve high-energy phosphate availability as well as have antioxidative, 
      neuroprotective, anti-lactatic, and calcium-homoeostatic effects. These 
      characteristics may have a direct impact on mitochondrion's survival and health 
      particularly during stressful conditions such as ischemia and injury. This 
      narrative review discusses current scientific evidence for use or supplemental 
      CrM as a therapeutic agent during conditions associated with mitochondrial 
      dysfunction. Based on this analysis, it appears that CrM supplementation may have 
      a role in improving cellular bioenergetics in several mitochondrial 
      dysfunction-related diseases, ischemic conditions, and injury pathology and 
      thereby could provide therapeutic benefit in the management of these conditions. 
      However, larger clinical trials are needed to explore these potential therapeutic 
      applications before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

AB  - Results of foreign and Russian studies indicate a higher mortality rate of 
      patients with concomitant cardiovascular diseases (CVD) due to the new 
      coronavirus infection COVID-19. It has been proven that arterial hypertension, as 
      one of the significant risk factors for the development of concomitant 
      cardiovascular diseases, is associated with a more severe prognosis of COVID-19. 
      This article presents the results of modern studies and large meta-analyzes of 
      necessity and safety of the use of blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
      system in patients with arterial hypertension and COVID-19. The data of studies 
      show that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) and a 
      thiazide-like diuretic is a pathogenetically rational combination. It realizes 
      various ways of lowering blood pressure by reducing the activity of the 
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is achieved by using an ACE 
      inhibitor, and natriuresis due to diuretics. As an example, a highly effective 
      fixed combination of drugs is considered, characterized by good tolerance, which 
      consists of an ACE inhibitor lisinopril and a thiazide-like diuretic indapamide 
      of prolonged action. The authors expressed the opinion that the appointment of 
      the fixed combination drug Diroton Plus (Gedeon Richter) will contribute to 
      effective control of blood pressure and organoprotection in conditions of 
      increased thrombogenic and prooxidative potential, characteristic of COVID-19 
      both in the acute stage and within the post-COVID Syndrome.

AB  - Thromboembolic complications and excessive inflammation are frequent in severe 
      COVID-19, potentially leading to long COVID. In non-COVID studies, we and others 
      demonstrated that circulating Reelin promotes leukocyte infiltration and 
      thrombosis. Thus, we hypothesized that Reelin participates in endothelial 
      dysfunction and hyperinflammation during COVID-19. We showed that Reelin was 
      increased in COVID-19 patients and correlated with the disease activity. In the 
      severe COVID-19 group, we observed a hyperinflammatory state, as judged by 
      increased concentration of cytokines (IL-1α, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17A), 
      chemokines (IP-10 and MIP-1β), and adhesion markers (E-selectin and ICAM-1). 
      Reelin level was correlated with IL-1α, IL-4, IP-10, MIP-1β, and ICAM-1, 
      suggesting a specific role for Reelin in COVID-19 progression. Furthermore, 
      Reelin and all of the inflammatory markers aforementioned returned to normal in a 
      long COVID cohort, showing that the hyperinflammatory state was resolved. 
      Finally, we tested Reelin inhibition with the anti-Reelin antibody CR-50 in hACE2 
      transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. CR-50 prophylactic treatment decreased 
      mortality and disease severity in this model. These results demonstrate a direct 
      proinflammatory function for Reelin in COVID-19 and identify it as a drug target. 
      This work opens translational clinical applications in severe SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and beyond in auto-inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Evaluating fluvoxamine for the outpatient treatment of COVID-19: A systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e2501
LID - 10.1002/rmv.2501 [doi]
AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
      aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of fluvoxamine for the 
      outpatient management of COVID-19. We conducted this review in accordance with 
      the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, CINAHL, Web of Science, and 
      CENTRAL up to 14 September 2023. Outcomes included incidence of hospitalisation, 
      healthcare utilization (emergency room visits and/or hospitalisation), mortality, 
      supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation requirements, serious adverse 
      events (SAEs) and non-adherence. Fluvoxamine 100 mg twice a day was associated 
      with reductions in the risk of hospitalisation (risk ratio [RR] 0.75, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 0.58-0.97; I (2)  = 0%) and reductions in the risk of 
      healthcare utilization (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.86; I (2)  = 0%). While no 
      increased SAEs were observed, fluvoxamine 100 mg twice a day was associated with 
      higher treatment non-adherence compared to placebo (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.22-2.14; I 
      (2)  = 53%). In subgroup analyses, fluvoxamine reduced healthcare utilization in 
      outpatients with BMI ≥30 kg/m(2) , but not in those with lower BMIs. While 
      fluvoxamine offers potential benefits in reducing healthcare utilization, its 
      efficacy may be most pronounced in high-risk patient populations. The observed 
      non-adherence rates highlight the need for better patient education and 
      counselling. Future investigations should reassess trial endpoints to include 
      outcomes relating to post-COVID sequelaes. Registration: This review was 
      prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023463829).

TI  - Short- and long-term effects of imatinib in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A 
      randomized trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We studied the short- and long-term effects of imatinib in 
      hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Participants were randomized to receive 
      standard of care (SoC) or SoC with imatinib. Imatinib dosage was 400 mg daily 
      until discharge (max 14 days). Primary outcomes were mortality at 30 days and 1 
      year. Secondary outcomes included recovery, quality of life and long COVID 
      symptoms at 1 year. We also performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
      randomized trials studying imatinib for 30-day mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 
      patients. RESULTS: We randomized 156 patients (73 in SoC and 83 in imatinib). 
      Among patients on imatinib, 7.2% had died at 30 days and 13.3% at 1 year, and in 
      SoC, 4.1% and 8.2% (adjusted HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.47-3.90). At 1 year, self-reported 
      recovery occurred in 79.0% in imatinib and in 88.5% in SoC (RR 0.91, 0.78-1.06). 
      We found no convincing difference in quality of life or symptoms. Fatigue (24%) 
      and sleep issues (20%) frequently bothered patients at one year. In the 
      meta-analysis, imatinib was associated with a mortality risk ratio of 0.73 
      (0.32-1.63; low certainty evidence). CONCLUSIONS: The evidence raises doubts 
      regarding benefit of imatinib in reducing mortality, improving recovery and 
      preventing long COVID symptoms in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

AB  - The devastating effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may not end when the acute 
      illness has terminated. A subset of COVID-19 patients may have symptoms that 
      persist for months. This condition has been described as 'long COVID'. From a 
      historical perspective, it has been recognized that serious long-term 
      neurological sequelae have been associated with RNA viruses such as influenza 
      viruses and coronaviruses. A potential intervention for early post-COVID-19 
      neuropsychiatric impairment may be the commonly employed, readily available, 
      reasonably priced macrolide antibiotic, azithromycin. We have observed a 
      favourable clinical response with azithromycin in three patients with 
      neurological symptoms associated with long COVID-19. We recommend considering 
      formal clinical trials using azithromycin for patients with post-COVID-19 
      infection neurological changes including 'COVID fog' or the more severe 
      neurological symptoms that may later develop.

LID - 219
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pears have been world-widely used as a sweet and nutritious food and 
      a folk medicine for more than two millennia. METHODS: We conducted a review from 
      ancient literatures to current reports to extract evidence-based functions of 
      pears. RESULTS: We found that pears have many active compounds, e.g., flavonoids, 
      triterpenoids, and phenolic acids including arbutin, chlorogenic acid, malaxinic 
      acid, etc. Most of researchers agree that the beneficial compounds are 
      concentrated in the peels. From various in vitro, in vivo, and human studies, the 
      medicinal functions of pears can be summarized as anti-diabetic,-obese, 
      -hyperlipidemic, -inflammatory, -mutagenic, and -carcinogenic effects, 
      detoxification of xenobiotics, respiratory and cardio-protective effects, and 
      skin whitening effects. Therefore, pears seem to be even effective for prevention 
      from Covid-19 or PM(2.5) among high susceptible people with multiple underlying 
      diseases. CONCLUSION: For the current or post Covid-19 era, pears have potential 
      for functional food or medicine for both of communicable and non-communicable 
      disease.

      Male and Female Outpatients.
PG  - 902140

LID - 902140
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the clinical characteristics and pathophysiological 
      mechanisms underlying post-COVID-19 fatigue are scarce. The main objective of 
      this study was to evaluate sex-specific humoral and T-cell responses associated 
      with post-COVID-19 fatigue in a sample of individuals treated as outpatients. 
      METHODS: At a median time of 279 (179;325) days after the acute infection, a 
      total of 281 individuals (45.9% men) aged 18-87 years old were included in the 
      analysis. The participants were examined at the University Hospital of Augsburg, 
      Southern Germany. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS). 
      Levels of anti-SARS-CoV2-spike IgG antibodies were measured by an enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and for exploration of the SARS-CoV2-specific T-cell 
      response, ex vivo ELISpot/FLUOROspot assays were conducted using an interferon-γ 
      (IFN-γ) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) SARS-CoV-iSpot kit. RESULTS: Women more 
      significantly suffered from post-COVID-19 fatigue in comparison to men (47.4% 
      versus 25.6%, p=0.0002). Females but not males with fatigue showed a 
      significantly lower number of T-cells producing IFN-γ, IL-2 or both IL-2 and IFNγ 
      in comparison with females without fatigue. In both sexes, serum levels of 
      anti-SARS-CoV2-spike IgG antibodies did not differ significantly between 
      participants with or without fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Development of fatigue after 
      acute COVID-19 disease might be associated with SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell 
      responses in women, but not men after a mild infection course treated outpatient.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Growing interest is directed to the outcomes of COVID-19 in survivors, 
      both in the convalescent period and in the long-term, which are responsible for 
      morbidity and quality of life deterioration. This article aims to describe the 
      mechanisms supporting the possible use of NAC as an adjuvant treatment for 
      post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search was performed 
      in PubMed/MEDLINE. RESULTS: Interstitial changes have been observed in the CT 
      scan of COVID-19 pneumonia. In patients with respiratory outcomes in the 
      post-COVID-19 stage, glutathione (GSH) deficiency was found and interpreted as a 
      reaction to the inflammatory cascade caused by the viral infection, while the 
      pathophysiological process of pulmonary fibrosis involves numerous cytokines, 
      such as TGF-β, TNF-α, IL-1, PDGF and VEGF. NAC has a good tolerability profile, 
      is easily administered orally and inexpensively, and has antioxidant and 
      anti-inflammatory effects that may target the pathophysiologic mechanisms 
      involved in pulmonary fibrosis. It may revert GSH deficiency, exerts direct and 
      indirect antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory activity and improves immune 
      T-cell response. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of action of NAC suggests a role in 
      the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis induced by COVID-19.

AB  - A vast majority of COVID-19 patients experience fatigue, extreme tiredness and 
      symptoms that persist beyond the active phase of the disease. This condition is 
      called post-COVID syndrome. The mechanisms by which the virus causes prolonged 
      illness are still unclear. The aim of this review is to gather information 
      regarding post-COVID syndrome so as to highlight its etiological basis and the 
      nutritional regimes and supplements that can mitigate, alleviate or relieve the 
      associated chronic fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders and continuing 
      inflammatory reactions. Naturally-occurring food supplements, such as acetyl 
      L-carnitine, hydroxytyrosol and vitamins B, C and D hold significant promise in 
      the management of post-COVID syndrome. In this pilot observational study, we 
      evaluated the effect of a food supplement containing hydroxytyrosol, acetyl 
      L-carnitine and vitamins B, C and D in improving perceived fatigue in patients 
      who recovered from COVID-19 but had post-COVID syndrome characterized by chronic 
      fatigue. The results suggest that the food supplement could proceed to clinical 
      trials of its efficacy in aiding the recovery of patients with long COVID.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recently, India witnessed an unprecedented surge of coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated mucormycosis (CAM) cases. In addition to 
      patient management issues, environmental Mucorales contamination possibly 
      contributed to the outbreak. A recent study evaluated environment contamination 
      by Mucorales in the hospital setting. However, a considerable number of CAM 
      patients were never admitted to a hospital before the development of the disease. 
      The present study, therefore, planned to evaluate Mucorales contamination of 
      patients' residences. METHODS: The residential environment of 25 patients with 
      CAM living in north India was surveyed. Air samples were collected from indoor 
      and immediate outdoor vicinity of the patients' residence and cultured on 
      Dichloran Rose-Bengal Chloramphenicol (DRBC) agar with benomyl for selective 
      isolation of Mucorales. Surface swab samples were also collected from the air 
      coolers fitted in those residences and cultured on DRBC agar. The isolates were 
      identified by phenotypic and genotypic methods. Amplified fragment length 
      polymorphism (AFLP) was employed to evaluate the genetic relatedness of the 
      environmental and patients' clinical isolates. RESULTS: The median spore count 
      (mean ± SD, cfu/m(3)) of Mucorales in the air of patients' bedrooms was 
      significantly higher than in the air in other rooms in those residences (3.55 
      versus 1.5, p = 0.003) or the air collected directly from the front of the air 
      cooler (p < 0.0001). The Mucorales spore count in the environment did not 
      correlate with either ventilation of the room or hygiene level of the patients' 
      residences. Rhizopus arrhizus was isolated from the environment of all patients' 
      residences (n = 25); other Mucorales species isolated were Cunninghamella 
      bertholletiae (n = 14), Rhizopus microsporus (n = 6), Rhizopus delemar (n = 6), 
      Syncephalastrum racemosum (n = 1), Lichtheimia corymbifera (n = 1), and Mucor 
      racemosus (n = 1). Genetic relatedness was observed between 11 environmental 
      isolates from the patients' bedrooms and respective clinical isolates from 
      patients. DISCUSSION: The study supported the view that the patients might have 
      acquired Mucorales from the home environment during the post-COVID-19 
      convalescence period. Universal masking at home during patients' convalescence 
      period and environmental decontamination could minimize exposure in those 
      susceptible patients.

TI  - Aminoadamantanes: from treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease to 
      symptom amelioration of long COVID-19 syndrome?
PG  - 101-107
LID - 10.1080/17512433.2023.2176301 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aminoadamantanes amantadine and memantine are well known. They 
      mainly act as N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists. AREAS COVERED: The antiviral drug 
      amantadine moderately ameliorates impaired motor behavior in patients with 
      Parkinson's disease. Memantine provides beneficial effects on memory function in 
      patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease already treated with acetylcholine 
      esterase inhibitors. Both compounds counteract impaired monoamine 
      neurotransmission with associated symptoms, such as depression. They improve 
      vigilance, lack of attention and concentration, fatigue syndromes according to 
      clinical findings in patients with chronic neurodegenerative processes. Their 
      extrasynaptic N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptor blockade weakens a prolonged influx 
      of Ca(2+) ions as the main responsible components of neuronal excitotoxicity. 
      This causes neuronal dying and associated functional deficits. EXPERT OPINION: We 
      suggest aminoadamantanes as future therapies for amelioration of short- and 
      long-term consequences of a COVID 19 infection. Particularly the extended-release 
      amantadine formulations will be suitable. They showed better clinical efficacy 
      compared with the conventional available compounds. Amantadine may particularly 
      be suitable for amelioration of fatigue or chronic exhaustion, memantine for 
      improvement of cognitive deficits. Clinical research in patients, who are 
      affected by the short- and long-term consequences of a COVID 19 infection, is 
      warranted to confirm these still hypothetical putative beneficial effects of 
      aminoadamantanes.

OAB - The drugs amantadine and memantine are known as aminoadamantanes. Amantadine 
      improves motor skills in patients with Parkinson’s disease. It also reduces 
      fatigue in individuals suffering from multiple sclerosis. Memantine improves 
      memory dysfunction linked to Alzheimer’s disease. Aminoadamantanes affect 
      communication between nerve cells by supporting neurotransmission of monoamines. 
      Clinical studies have found that these drugs benefit patients with chronic 
      neurodegenerative diseases, who have depression, fatigue, loss of attention or 
      concentration deficits. These brain function problems may also appear to some 
      extent due to COVID-19 infection. We suggest that aminoadamantanes could improve 
      these problems in COVID-19 patients in both the short and long term. Clinical 
      research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  - Immune Stimulation with Imiquimod to Best Face SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Prevent 
      Long COVID.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25147661 [doi]
LID - 7661
AB  - Through widespread immunization against SARS-CoV-2 prior to or post-infection, a 
      substantial segment of the global population has acquired both humoral and 
      cellular immunity, and there has been a notable reduction in the incidence of 
      severe and fatal cases linked to this virus and accelerated recovery times for 
      those infected. Nonetheless, a significant demographic, comprising around 20% to 
      30% of the adult population, remains unimmunized due to diverse factors. 
      Furthermore, alongside those recovered from the infection, there is a subset of 
      the population experiencing persistent symptoms referred to as Long COVID. This 
      condition is more prevalent among individuals with underlying health conditions 
      and immune system impairments. Some Long COVID pathologies stem from direct 
      damage inflicted by the viral infection, whereas others arise from inadequate 
      immune system control over the infection or suboptimal immunoregulation. There 
      are differences in the serum cytokines and miRNA profiles between infected 
      individuals who develop severe COVID-19 or Long COVID and those who control 
      adequately the infection. This review delves into the advantages and constraints 
      associated with employing imiquimod in human subjects to enhance the immune 
      response during SARS-CoV-2 immunization. Restoration of the immune system can 
      modify it towards a profile of non-susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. An adequate 
      immune system has the potential to curb viral propagation, mitigate symptoms, and 
      ameliorate the severe consequences of the infection.

PG  - 2057-2068
LID - 10.1007/s00011-024-01942-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pentoxifylline (PTX) affects most blood components and the blood 
      vessels, potentially modulating various conditions. Due to its impact on markers 
      linked to COVID-19 severity, research has explored PTX for acute COVID-19. 
      Following the widespread administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, there has been 
      a notable and consistently growing increase in research focusing on long COVID. 
      Consequently, our examination of relevant acute COVID-19 data shall additionally 
      be contextualized into long COVID research. METHODS: Various Databases were 
      searched until July 2024 for all primary clinical studies on Pentoxifylline (PTX) 
      in COVID-19. RESULTS: Studies were on acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 where PTX 
      was an adjuvant to standard therapy for ethical and practical reasons under the 
      circumstance. PTX generally reduced hospitalization duration and improved some 
      inflammatory markers, but its impact on mortality was inconsistent. Adverse 
      events were minimal. Meta-analysis revealed a significant reduction in 
      hospitalization duration. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis 
      suggest that adding pentoxifylline (PTX) to standard COVID-19 therapy may 
      significantly reduce hospitalization duration and improve some inflammatory 
      markers. However, its impact on mortality rates is inconclusive. Adverse events 
      are minimal. PTX can be favorable as an add-on in managing acute COVID-19 and 
      could reduce the risk of long COVID, as well as assist in managing many of its 
      most common symptoms.

TI  - Pharmacogenomic Landscape of Ivermectin and Selective Antioxidants: Exploring 
      Gene Interplay in the Context of Long COVID.
LID - 10.3390/ijms242015471 [doi]
LID - 15471
AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread panic and fear among the global 
      population. As such, repurposing drugs are being used as viable therapeutic 
      options due to the limited effective treatments for Long COVID symptoms. 
      Ivermectin is one of the emerging repurposed drugs that has been shown effective 
      to have antiviral effects in clinical trials. In addition, antioxidant compounds 
      are also gaining attention due to their capabilities of reducing inflammation and 
      severity of symptoms. Due to the absence of knowledge in pharmacogenomics and 
      modes of actions in the human body for these compounds, this study aims to 
      provide a pharmacogenomic profile for the combination of ivermectin and six 
      selected antioxidants (epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), curcumin, sesamin, 
      anthocyanins, quercetin, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC)) as potentially effective 
      regimens for long COVID symptoms. Results showed that there were 12 interacting 
      genes found among the ivermectin, 6 antioxidants, and COVID-19. For network 
      pharmacology, the 12 common interacting genes/proteins had the highest 
      associations with Pertussis pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic 
      complications, and colorectal cancer in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
      Genomes (KEGG) analyses. Disease analyses also revealed that the top three 
      relevant diseases with COVID-19 infections were diabetes mellitus, ischemia, 
      reperfusion injury. We also identified 6 potential target microRNAs (miRNAs) of 
      the 12 commonly curated genes used as molecular biomarkers for COVID-19 
      treatments. The established pharmacogenomic network, disease analyses, and 
      identified miRNAs could facilitate developments of effective regimens for chronic 
      sequelae of COVID-19 especially in this post-pandemic era. However, further 
      studies and clinical trials are needed to substantiate the effectiveness and 
      dosages for COVID-19 treatments.

TI  - Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on enrollment in medications for opioid use 
      disorder (MOUD) in Vancouver, Canada: An interrupted time series analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In anticipation of COVID-19 related disruptions to opioid use 
      disorder (OUD) care, new provincial and federal guidance for the management of 
      OUD and risk mitigation guidance (RMG) for prescription of pharmaceutical opioids 
      were introduced in British Columbia, Canada, in March 2020. This study evaluated 
      the combined impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and counteracting OUD policies on 
      enrollment in medications for OUD (MOUD). METHODS: Using data from three cohorts 
      of people with presumed OUD in Vancouver, we conducted an interrupted time series 
      analysis to estimate the combined effects impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
      counteracting OUD policies on the prevalence of enrollment in MOUD overall, as 
      well as in individual MOUDs (methadone, buprenorphine/naloxone, slow-release oral 
      morphine) between November 2018 and November 2021, controlling for pre-existing 
      trends. In sub-analysis we considered RMG opioids together with MOUD. RESULTS: We 
      included 760 participants with presumed OUD. In the post-COVID-19 period, MOUD 
      and slow-release oral morphine prevalence rates showed an estimated immediate 
      increase in level (+7.6%, 95% CI: 0.6%, 14.6% and 1.8%, 95% CI: 0.3%, 3.3%, 
      respectively), followed by a decline in the monthly trend (-0.8% per month, 95% 
      CI: -1.4%, -0.2% and -0.2% per month, 95% CI: -0.4, -0.1, respectively). There 
      were no significant changes in the prevalence trends of enrollment in methadone, 
      buprenorphine/naloxone, or when RMG opioids were considered together with MOUD. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite immediate improvements in MOUD enrollment in the 
      post-COVID-19 period, this beneficial trend reversed over time. RMG opioids 
      appeared to have provided additional benefits to sustain retention in OUD care.

TI  - Parosmia COVID-19 Related Treated by a Combination of Olfactory Training and 
      Ultramicronized PEA-LUT: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines11041109 [doi]
LID - 1109
AB  - During COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians have had to deal with an ever-increasing 
      number of cases of olfactory disturbances after SARS-CoV-2 infections and in some 
      people this problem persisted for long time after negativization from virus. This 
      a prospective randomized controlled trial aims at evaluating the efficacy of 
      ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and Luteolin (LUT) (umPEA-LUT) and 
      olfactory training (OT) compared to OT alone for the treatment of smell disorders 
      in Italian post-COVID population. We included patients with smell loss and 
      parosmia who were randomized and assigned to Group 1 (intervention group; daily 
      treatment with umPEA-LUT oral supplement and OT) or Group 2 (control group; daily 
      treatment with placebo and OT). All subjects were treated for 90 consecutive 
      days. The Sniffin' Sticks identification test was used to assess the olfactory 
      functions at the baseline (T0) and the end of the treatment (T1). Patients were 
      queried regarding any perception of altered olfaction (parosmia) or aversive 
      smell, such as cacosmia, gasoline-type smell, or otherwise at the same 
      observational points. This study confirmed the efficacy of combination of 
      umPEA-LUT and olfactory training as treatment of quantitative smell alteration 
      COVID-19 related, but the efficacy of the supplement for parosmia was limited. 
      UmpEA-LUT is useful for the treatment of brain neuro-inflammation (origin of 
      quantity smell disorders) but has limited/no effect on peripheral damage 
      (olfactory nerve, neuro-epithelium) that is responsible of quality disorders.

AB  - COVID-19 has become the focal point since 2019 after the outbreak of coronavirus 
      disease. Many drugs are being tested and used to treat coronavirus infections; 
      different kinds of vaccines are also introduced as preventive measure. 
      Alternative therapeutics are as well incorporated into the health guidelines of 
      some countries. This research aimed to look into the underlying mechanisms of 
      functional foods and how they may improve the long-term post COVID-19 
      cardiovascular, diabetic, and respiratory complications through their bioactive 
      compounds. The potentiality of nine functional foods for post COVID-19 
      complications was investigated through computational approaches. A total of 266 
      bioactive compounds of these foods were searched via extensive literature 
      reviewing. Three highly associated targets namely troponin I interacting kinase 
      (TNNI3K), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), and transforming growth factor beta 1 
      (TGF-β1) were selected for cardiovascular, diabetes, and respiratory disorders, 
      respectively, after COVID-19 infections. Best docked compounds were further 
      analyzed by network pharmacological tools to explore their interactions with 
      complication-related genes (MAPK1 and HSP90AA1 for cardiovascular, PPARG and 
      TNF-alpha for diabetes, and AKT-1 for respiratory disorders). Seventy-one 
      suggested compounds out of one-hundred and thirty-nine (139) docked compounds in 
      network pharmacology recommended 169 Gene Ontology (GO) items and 99 Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathways preferably AKT signaling 
      pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, ACE2 receptor signaling pathway, insulin 
      signaling pathway, and PPAR signaling pathway. Among the chosen functional foods, 
      black cumin, fenugreek, garlic, ginger, turmeric, bitter melon, and Indian 
      pennywort were found to modulate the actions. Results demonstrate that aforesaid 
      functional foods have attenuating roles to manage post COVID-19 complications. 
      PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Functional foods have been approaching a greater interest 
      due to their medicinal uses other than gastronomic pleasure. Nine functional food 
      resources have been used in this research for their traditional and 
      ethnopharmacological uses, but their directive-role in modulating the genes 
      involved in the management of post COVID-19 complications is inadequately studied 
      and reported. Therefore, the foods types used in this research may be prioritized 
      to be used as functional foods for ameliorating the major post COVID-19 
      complications through appropriate science.

TI  - Urokinase System in Pathogenesis of Pulmonary Fibrosis: A Hidden Threat of 
      COVID-19.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24021382 [doi]
LID - 1382
AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis is a common and threatening post-COVID-19 complication with 
      poorly resolved molecular mechanisms and no established treatment. The 
      plasminogen activator system, including urokinase (uPA) and urokinase receptor 
      (uPAR), is involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and contributes to the 
      development of lung injury and post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis, although their 
      cellular and molecular underpinnings still remain obscure. The aim of the current 
      study was to assess the role of uPA and uPAR in the pathogenesis of pulmonary 
      fibrosis. We analyzed uPA and uPAR expression in human lung tissues from COVID-19 
      patients with pulmonary fibrosis using single-cell RNA-seq and 
      immunohistochemistry. We modeled lung fibrosis in Plau-/- and Plaur-/- mice upon 
      bleomycin instillation and explored the effect of uPAR downregulation in A549 and 
      BEAS-2B lung epithelial cells. We found that uPAR expression drastically 
      decreased in the epithelial airway basal cells and monocyte/macrophage cells, 
      whereas uPA accumulation significantly increased in tissue samples of COVID-19 
      patients. Lung injury and fibrosis in Plaur-/- vs. WT mice upon bleomycin 
      instillation revealed that uPAR deficiency resulted in pro-fibrogenic uPA 
      accumulation, IL-6 and ACE2 upregulation in lung tissues and was associated with 
      severe fibrosis, weight loss and poor survival. uPAR downregulation in A549 and 
      BEAS-2B was linked to an increased N-cadherin expression, indicating the onset of 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition and potentially contributing to pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Here for the first time, we demonstrate that plasminogen treatment 
      reversed lung fibrosis in Plaur-/- mice: the intravenous injection of 1 mg of 
      plasminogen on the 21st day of bleomycin-induced fibrosis resulted in a more than 
      a two-fold decrease in the area of lung fibrosis as compared to non-treated mice 
      as evaluated by the 42nd day. The expression and function of the plasminogen 
      activator system are dysregulated upon COVID-19 infection, leading to excessive 
      pulmonary fibrosis and worsening the prognosis. The potential of plasminogen as a 
      life-saving treatment for non-resolving post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis warrants 
      further investigation.

TI  - Potential "Therapeutic" Effects of Tocotrienol-Rich Fraction (TRF) and Carotene 
      "Against" Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis in Rats via TGF-β/Smad, 
      PI3K/Akt/mTOR and NF-κB Signaling Pathways.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a chronic, progressive, and, ultimately, 
      terminal interstitial disease caused by a variety of factors, ranging from 
      genetics, bacterial, and viral infections, to drugs and other influences. Varying 
      degrees of PF and its rapid progress have been widely reported in post-COVID-19 
      patients and there is consequently an urgent need to develop an appropriate, 
      cost-effective approach for the prevention and management of PF. AIM: The 
      potential "therapeutic" effect of the tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) and 
      carotene against bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis was investigated in rats 
      via the modulation of TGF-β/Smad, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and NF-κB signaling pathways. 
      DESIGN/METHODS: Lung fibrosis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by a single 
      intratracheal BLM (5 mg/kg) injection. These rats were subsequently treated with 
      TRF (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body wt/day), carotene (10 mg/kg body wt/day), or a 
      combination of TRF (200 mg/kg body wt/day) and carotene (10 mg/kg body wt/day) 
      for 28 days by gavage administration. A group of normal rats was provided with 
      saline as a substitute for BLM as the control. Lung function and biochemical, 
      histopathological, and molecular alterations were studied in the lung tissues. 
      RESULTS: Both the TRF and carotene treatments were found to significantly restore 
      the BLM-induced alterations in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions. The 
      treatments appeared to show pneumoprotective effects through the upregulation of 
      antioxidant status, downregulation of MMP-7 and inflammatory cytokine 
      expressions, and reduction in collagen accumulation (hydroxyproline). We 
      demonstrated that TRF and carotene ameliorate BLM-induced lung injuries through 
      the inhibition of apoptosis, the induction of TGF-β1/Smad, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and 
      NF-κB signaling pathways. Furthermore, the increased expression levels were shown 
      to be significantly and dose-dependently downregulated by TRF (50, 100, and 200 
      mg/kg body wt/day) treatment in high probability. The histopathological findings 
      further confirmed that the TRF and carotene treatments had significantly 
      attenuated the BLM-induced lung injury in rats. CONCLUSION: The results of this 
      study clearly indicate the ability of TRF and carotene to restore the antioxidant 
      system and to inhibit proinflammatory cytokines. These findings, thus, revealed 
      the potential of TRF and carotene as preventive candidates for the treatment of 
      PF in the future.

TI  - Interferons and epigenetic mechanisms in training, priming and tolerance of 
      monocytes and hematopoietic progenitors.
PG  - 257-275
LID - 10.1111/imr.13330 [doi]
AB  - Training and priming of innate immune cells involve preconditioning by PAMPs, 
      DAMPs, and/or cytokines that elicits stronger induction of inflammatory genes 
      upon secondary challenge. Previous models distinguish training and priming based 
      upon whether immune activation returns to baseline prior to secondary challenge. 
      Tolerance is a protective mechanism whereby potent stimuli induce refractoriness 
      to secondary challenge. Training and priming are important for innate memory 
      responses that protect against infection, efficacy of vaccines, and maintaining 
      innate immune cells in a state of readiness; tolerance prevents toxicity from 
      excessive immune activation. Dysregulation of these processes can contribute to 
      pathogenesis of autoimmune/inflammatory conditions, post-COVID-19 
      hyperinflammatory states, or sepsis-associated immunoparalysis. Training, 
      priming, and tolerance regulate similar "signature" inflammatory genes such as 
      TNF, IL6, and IL1B and utilize overlapping epigenetic mechanisms. We review how 
      interferons (IFNs), best known for activating JAK-STAT signaling and 
      interferon-stimulated genes, also play a key role in regulating training, 
      priming, and tolerance via chromatin-mediated mechanisms. We present new data on 
      how monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation modulates IFN-γ-mediated priming, 
      affects regulation of AP-1 and CEBP activity, and attenuates superinduction of 
      inflammatory genes. We present a "training-priming continuum" model that 
      integrates IFN-mediated priming into current concepts about training and 
      tolerance and proposes a central role for STAT1 and IRF1.

TI  - Tuberculosis in individuals who recovered from COVID-19: A systematic review of 
      case reports.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of COVID-19 overwhelmed tuberculosis (TB) prevention 
      and control, resulting in a decrease in TB detection rate and an increase in TB 
      deaths. Furthermore, the temporary immunosuppressive effects, lung inflammation, 
      and the corticosteroids used to treat COVID-19, may play a direct role in 
      immunosuppression, leading to reactivation of either previous infection or latent 
      TB or the development of new TB. Thus, the aim of this study was to review TB 
      incidence in individuals who recovered from COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a 
      systematic search of available databases for previously published studies that 
      reported TB in COVID-19 survivors. The PRISMA checklist was used to guide the 
      review, and the JBI checklist was used to evaluate the study's quality. The 
      descriptive data were summarized. RESULTS: Data were extracted from 21 studies 
      conducted in 13 countries having 33 cases. The median age was 44 years (range; 
      13.5-80), and more than half (18, 54.5%) were males. Twelve patients immigrated 
      from TB endemic settings. All 17 patients assessed for HIV were seronegative, and 
      all 11 patients assessed for BCG vaccination status were vaccinated. The majority 
      (20, 69%) of patients had some type of comorbidity with diabetes (12/29) and 
      hypertension (9/29) being the most common. Four patients (30.77%) had a history 
      of TB. Corticosteroids were used to treat COVID-19 in 62.5% (10) of individuals. 
      Dexamethasone, remdesivir, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and enoxaparin were 
      the most commonly used drugs to treat COVID-19. The most common TB symptoms were 
      fever, cough, weight loss, dyspnea, and fatigue. Twenty, eleven, and two patients 
      developed pulmonary, extrapulmonary, and disseminated/miliary TB respectively. It 
      may take up to seven months after COVID-19 recovery to develop tuberculosis. Data 
      on the final treatment outcome was found for 24 patients, and five patients died 
      during the anti-TB treatment period. CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis after recovering 
      from COVID-19 is becoming more common, potentially leading to a TB outbreak in 
      the post-COVID-19 era. The immunosuppressive nature of the disease and its 
      treatment modalities may contribute to post COVID-19 TB. Thus, we recommend a 
      further study with a large sample size. Furthermore, we recommend feasibility 
      studies to assess and treat latent TB in COVID-19 patients residing in TB endemic 
      counties since treatment of latent TB is done only in TB non-endemic countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In post-coronavirus disease-19 (post-COVID-19) conditions (long 
      COVID), systemic vascular dysfunction is implicated, but the mechanisms are 
      uncertain, and the treatment is imprecise. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients 
      convalescing after hospitalization for COVID-19 and risk factor matched controls 
      underwent multisystem phenotyping using blood biomarkers, cardiorenal and 
      pulmonary imaging, and gluteal subcutaneous biopsy (NCT04403607). Small 
      resistance arteries were isolated and examined using wire myography, 
      histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and spatial transcriptomics. 
      Endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside) and -dependent (acetylcholine) 
      vasorelaxation and vasoconstriction to the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist, 
      U46619, and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the presence or absence of a RhoA/Rho-kinase 
      inhibitor (fasudil), were investigated. Thirty-seven patients, including 27 (mean 
      age 57 years, 48% women, 41% cardiovascular disease) 3 months post-COVID-19 and 
      10 controls (mean age 57 years, 20% women, 30% cardiovascular disease), were 
      included. Compared with control responses, U46619-induced constriction was 
      increased (P = 0.002) and endothelium-independent vasorelaxation was reduced in 
      arteries from COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001). This difference was abolished by 
      fasudil. Histopathology revealed greater collagen abundance in COVID-19 arteries 
      {Masson's trichrome (MT) 69.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 67.8-71.7]; 
      picrosirius red 68.6% [95% CI: 64.4-72.8]} vs. controls [MT 64.9% (95% CI: 
      59.4-70.3) (P = 0.028); picrosirius red 60.1% (95% CI: 55.4-64.8), (P = 0.029)]. 
      Greater phosphorylated myosin light chain antibody-positive staining in vascular 
      smooth muscle cells was observed in COVID-19 arteries (40.1%; 95% CI: 30.9-49.3) 
      vs. controls (10.0%; 95% CI: 4.4-15.6) (P < 0.001). In proof-of-concept studies, 
      gene pathways associated with extracellular matrix alteration, proteoglycan 
      synthesis, and viral mRNA replication appeared to be upregulated. CONCLUSION: 
      Patients with post-COVID-19 conditions have enhanced vascular fibrosis and myosin 
      light change phosphorylation. Rho-kinase activation represents a novel 
      therapeutic target for clinical trials.

TI  - Fatigue in Covid-19 survivors: The potential impact of a nutritional supplement 
      on muscle strength and function.
PG  - 215-221

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue with reduced tolerance to exercise is a common persistent 
      long-lasting feature amongst COVID-19 survivors. The assessment of muscle 
      function in this category of patients is often neglected. AIM: To evaluate the 
      potential impact of a daily supplementation based on amino acids, minerals, 
      vitamins, and plant extracts (Apportal®) on muscle function, body composition, 
      laboratory parameters and self-rated health in a small group of COVID-19 
      survivors affected by fatigue. METHODS: Thirty participants were enrolled among 
      patients affected by physical fatigue during or after acute COVID-19 and admitted 
      to the post-COVID-19 outpatient service at Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli in Rome 
      between 1st March 2021 and 30th April 2021. All participants were evaluated at 
      first visit (t0) and at control visit (t1), after taking a daily sachet of 
      Apportal® for 28 days. Muscle function was analyzed using hand grip strength 
      test, exhaustion strength time and the number of repetitions at one-minute chair 
      stand test. Body composition was assessed with bioelectrical impedance analysis 
      (BIA). Laboratory parameters, including standard blood biochemistry and ferritin 
      levels, were evaluated at the first visit and during the control visit. A quick 
      evaluation of self-rated health, before COVID-19, at t0 and t1, was obtained 
      through a visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Participants aged 60 years and 
      older were 13 (43%). Females represented the 70% of the study sample. 
      Participants hospitalized for COVID-19 with low-flow oxygen supplementation 
      represented the 43.3% of the study sample while 3.3% received noninvasive 
      ventilation (NIV) or invasive ventilation. Hand grip strength improved from 
      26.3 Kg to 28.9 Kg (p < 0.05) at t1 as compared to t0. The mean time of strength 
      exhaustion increased from 31.7 s (sec) at t0 to 47.5 s at t1 (p < 0.05). 
      Participants performed a higher number of repetitions (28.3 vs. 22.0; p < 0.05) 
      during the one-minute chair stand test at t1 as compared to t0. A trend, although 
      not significant, in reduction of ferritin levels was found after nutritional 
      supplementation (94.4 vs. 84.3, respectively; p = 0.01). The self-rated health 
      status increased by at least 13 points (t0, mean 57.6 ± 5.86; t1, mean 
      71.4 ± 6.73; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: After 28 days of nutritional supplementation 
      with Apportal® in COVID-19 survivors affected by fatigue with reduced tolerance 
      to exercise, we found a significant improvement in means of muscle strength and 
      physical performance, associated with enhancement of self-rated health status 
      between t0 and t1.

TI  - Glutathione-related antioxidant defence, DNA damage, and DNA repair in patients 
      suffering from post-COVID conditions.
PG  - 216-226

AB  - Post-COVID conditions are defined as the continuation of the symptoms of 
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 3 months after the initial Severe Acute 
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, with no other 
      explanation. Post-COVID conditions are seen among 30%-60% of patients with 
      asymptomatic or mild forms of COVID-19. The underlying pathophysiological 
      mechanisms of post-COVID conditions are not known. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      activation of the immune system leads to increased production of reactive oxygen 
      molecules, depleted antioxidant reserve, and finally occurrence of oxidative 
      stress. In oxidative stress conditions, DNA damage increases and DNA repair 
      systems impair. In this study, glutathione (GSH) level, glutathione peroxidase 
      (GPx) activity, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) level, basal, induced, and 
      post-repair DNA damage were investigated in individuals suffering from post-COVID 
      conditions. In the red blood cells, GSH levels and GPx activities were measured 
      with a spectrophotometric assay and a commercial kit. Basal, in vitro H2O2 
      (hydrogen peroxide)-induced, and post-repair DNA damage (DNA damage after a 
      repair incubation following H2O2-treatment, in vitro) were determined in 
      lymphocytes by the comet assay. The urinary 8-OHdG levels were measured by using 
      a commercial ELISA kit. No significant difference was found between the patient 
      and control groups for GSH level, GPx activity, and basal and H2O2-induced DNA 
      damage. Post-repair DNA damage was found to be higher in the patient group than 
      those in the control group. Urinary 8-OHdG level was lower in the patient group 
      compared to the control group. In the control group, GSH level and post-repair 
      DNA damage were higher in the vaccinated individuals. In conclusion, oxidative 
      stress formed due to the immune response against SARS-COV-2 may impair DNA repair 
      mechanisms. Defective DNA repair may be an underlying pathological mechanism of 
      post-COVID conditions.

TI  - The use of amantadine in the prevention of progression and treatment of COVID-19 
      symptoms in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COV-PREVENT): Study 
      rationale and design.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19, a disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is 
      asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in most cases. Some patients, usually burdened 
      with risk factors develop acute respiratory failure and other organ dysfunction. 
      In such cases, the mortality rate is very high despite the use of intensive 
      therapy. Amantadine has complex activity including antiviral, antiinflammatory 
      and dopaminergic effects. This clinical trial will assess the efficacy and safety 
      of amantadine in the prevention of COVID-19 progression toward acute respiratory 
      failure and neurological complications. METHODS AND RESULTS: The trial will 
      enroll 200 patients who are positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and have one or 
      more risk factors for worsening the disease. These patients will be included as 
      hospitalized or ambulatory subjects for early treatment of illness. The 
      recruitment will take place in 8 centers covering different regions of Poland. 
      For 14 days they will be given either 200 mg of amantadine a day or placebo. Our 
      hypothesis is a considerable reduction in the number of patients with progression 
      toward respiratory insufficiency or neurological complications thanks to the 
      treatment of amantadine. CONCLUSIONS: Demonstrating the efficacy and safety of 
      amantadine treatment in improving the clinical condition of patients diagnosed 
      with COVID-19 is of great importance in combating the effects of the pandemic. It 
      has potential to influence on the severity and course of neurological 
      complications, which are very common and persist long after the infection as 
      long-COVID syndrome. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov

TI  - Anti-Inflammatory and Neuroprotective Polyphenols Derived from the European Olive 
      Tree, Olea europaea L., in Long COVID and Other Conditions Involving Cognitive 
      Impairment.

AB  - The European olive tree, Olea europaea L., and its polyphenols hold great 
      therapeutic potential to treat neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. This 
      review examines the evidence for the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective 
      actions of olive polyphenols and their potential in the treatment of long COVID 
      and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
      disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Key findings suggest that olive 
      polyphenols exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and 
      antiviral properties, making them promising candidates for therapeutic 
      intervention, especially when formulated in unique combinations. Recommendations 
      for future research directions include elucidating molecular pathways through 
      mechanistic studies, exploring the therapeutic implications of olive polyphenol 
      supplementation, and conducting clinical trials to assess efficacy and safety. 
      Investigating potential synergistic effects with other agents addressing 
      different targets is suggested for further exploration. The evidence reviewed 
      strengthens the translational value of olive polyphenols in conditions involving 
      cognitive dysfunction and emphasizes the novelty of new formulations.

AB  - Pharyngitis is one of the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which features 
      specific changes in the pharyngoscopic pattern, long fluctuating course and 
      increase in symptoms severity after a physical exercise, which requires long-term 
      therapy with topical agents. A comparative analysis of Tonsilgon N effect on the 
      course of SARS-CoV-2 associated pharyngitis as well as post-COVID syndrome 
      development was carried out in this study. 164 patients with acute pharyngitis 
      associated with SARS-CoV-2 were included in the study. Main group (n=81) received 
      Tonsilgon N oral drops in addition to the standard treatment regimens for 
      pharyngitis and control group (n=83) received standard regimen alone. Treatment 
      regimen lasted for 21 days for both groups, followed by follow up examination in 
      12 weeks for assessment of post-COVID syndrome development. Patients taking 
      Tonsilgon N showed a statistically significant symptoms improvement in throat 
      pain relief (p=0.002) and throat discomfort (p=0.004), however, no statistically 
      significant difference in two groups were observed in inflammation severity based 
      on pharyngoscopy examination (p=0.558). Addition of Tolzilgon N to the regimen 
      reduced occurrence of secondary bacterial infections and therefore use of 
      antibiotics more than 2.8 times (p<0.001). Compared with the control group long 
      term topical therapy with Tolzilgon N showed no increase in occurrence of side 
      effects such as allergic reactions (p=0.311) as well as subjective burning 
      sensations in the throat (p=0.849). In main group occurrence of post-COVID 
      syndrome was observed 3.3 times less than in the control group (7.2% vs 25.9%, 
      p=0.001). These results give us the ground for indication of Tonsilgon N use in 
      the treatment of viral pharyngitis associated with SARS-CoV 2 infection and in 
      prevention of post-COVID syndrome.

PG  - 141-146
LID - 10.1080/08923973.2022.2037631 [doi]
AB  - Over the last twenty months, the attention of the world has been focusing on 
      managing the unprecedented and devastating wave of COVID-19 caused by severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) and mitigating its impacts. 
      Recent findings indicated that high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are 
      leading cause of poor prognosis in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Presently, the 
      multiple variants and highly contagious nature of virus makes challenge 
      humongous. The shortage and vaccine hesitancy also prompted to develop antiviral 
      therapeutic agents to manage this pandemic. Nanocurcumin has potential antiviral 
      activities and also beneficial in post COVID inflammatory complications. We have 
      developed nanocurcumin based formulation using pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) 
      which protects cardio-pulmonary function and mitochondrial homeostasis in 
      hypobaric hypoxia induced right ventricular hypertrophy in animal model and human 
      ventricular cardiomyocytes. Nanocurcumin based formulation (NCF) with improved 
      bioavailability, has proven several holistic therapeutic effects including 
      myocardial protection, and prevents edema formation, anti-inflammatory and 
      antioxidant properties, maintaining metabolic and mitochondrial homeostasis under 
      hypoxic condition. The post COVID-inflammatory syndrome also reported to cause 
      impaired heart function, lung injuries and increased C-reactive protein level in 
      severely ill patients. Thus, we speculate that NCF could be a new treatment 
      option to manage post COVID-19 inflammatory syndrome.

AB  - PURPOSE: The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic mainly affects the 
      respiratory system; however, several oral and maxillofacial post-COVID-19 
      complications have also been observed. This series reports the growing number of 
      osteonecrosis cases associated with post-COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: This is a retrospective, multi-center case series that reports cases 
      with maxillary osteonecrosis after various periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 
      period between January and August 2021 based on the PROCESS guidelines. RESULTS: 
      Twelve cases were reported with post-COVID-19 manifestation of spontaneous 
      osteonecrosis of the maxillary jaw. Five patients were hospitalized during 
      COVID-19 management and all of the twelve cases had at least one systematic 
      Co-morbidity, and undertake corticosteroids prescription based on the COVID-19 
      disease treatment protocol. The mean onset of osteonecrosis symptoms appearance 
      was 5.5 ± 2.43 weeks calculated from the day of the negative PCR test. The 
      management was successfully done through surgical debridement and pre and 
      post-operative antibiotics. No anti-fungal medications were prescribed as the 
      fungal culture and the histopathological report were negative. CONCLUSION: 
      Post-COVID-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (PC-RONJ) could be now considered as 
      one of the potential post-COVID-19 oral and maxillofacial complications that 
      occurs unprovokedly and mainly in the maxilla.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myalgia reflects generalized inflammation and cytokine response and 
      can be the onset symptom of 36% of patients with COVID-19. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) 
      and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α) levels in plasma and upper respiratory 
      secretions directly correlate with the magnitude of viral replication, fever, and 
      respiratory and systemic symptoms, including musculoskeletal clinical 
      manifestations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our work is to report literature scientific 
      investigation clinical protocol to reduce the immunomodulation and inflammatory 
      response nutraceutical therapy associated with dexamethasone and how can reduce 
      the expression of Interlukina-6(IL-6) and myalgia due to COVID-19. METHODS: We 
      searched in Pubmed and Cochrane the nautriceutical drugs to treat the immune 
      modulation of organism to COVID-19. We put these keywords: immune inflammation, 
      desease descriptions, epidemiology COVID-19; immunomodulations; IL-6; Rheumatic 
      Symptoms; Joint; Musculoskeletal Disorders; dexamethasone; Polydatin; Zinc; 
      Melatonin; N- Acetyl Cysteine; Colostrum; L- Glutamine; Vitamin D3. RESULTS: We 
      found 61 papers. All the authors analyze them. After the Analyze we suggest the 
      use of response nutraceutical therapy associated with dexamethasone can reduce 
      the expression of Interlukina-6(IL-6) and myalgia due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: 
      According the scientific literature nutraceutical therapy associated with 
      dexamethasone can reduce the expression of Interlukina-6(IL-6) and myalgia due to 
      COVID-19.

AB  - As the SARS-COV-2 becomes a global pandemic, many researchers have a concern 
      about the long COVID-19 complications. Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic 
      encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a persistent, debilitating, and unexplained fatigue 
      disorder. We investigated psychological morbidities such as CFS and 
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among survivors of COVID-19 over 6 months. 
      All COVID-19 survivors from the university-affiliated hospital of Tehran, Iran, 
      were assessed 6 months after infection onset by a previously validated 
      questionnaire based on the Fukuda guidelines for CFS/EM and DSM-5 Checklist for 
      PTSD (The Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 or PCL-5) to 
      determine the presence of stress disorder and chronic fatigue problems. A total 
      of 120 patients were enrolled. The prevalence rate of fatigue symptoms was 17.5%. 
      Twelve (10%) screened positive for chronic idiopathic fatigue (CIF), 6 (5%) for 
      CFS-like with insufficient fatigue syndrome (CFSWIFS), and 3 (2.5%) for CFS. The 
      mean total scores in PCL-5 were 9.27 ± 10.76 (range:0-44), and the prevalence 
      rate of PTSD was 5.8%. There was no significant association after adjusting 
      between CFS and PTSD, gender, comorbidities, and chloroquine phosphate 
      administration. The obtained data revealed the prevalence of CFS among patients 
      with COVID-19, which is almost similar to CFS prevalence in the general 
      population. Moreover, PTSD in patients with COVID-19 is not associated with the 
      increased risk of CFS. Our study suggested that medical institutions should pay 
      attention to the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak.

TI  - Multi-Level Immune Support by Vitamins C and D during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic.
LID - 10.3390/nu14030689 [doi]
LID - 689
AB  - Vitamins C and D have well-known immune supportive roles, with deficiencies in 
      both vitamins predisposing to increased risk and severity of respiratory 
      infections. Numerous studies have indicated that administration of these 
      vitamins, particularly to people who are deficient, can decrease the risk and 
      severity of respiratory infections. This has stimulated an interest in the 
      potential efficacy of these vitamins in people with novel coronavirus 
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its more severe disease (COVID-19). In this overview, 
      we highlight the current research evidence around the multiple levels of immune 
      support provided by vitamins C and D in the context of general respiratory 
      infections and with a focus on the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These include: 
      prevention of infection; attenuating infection symptoms and severity; adjunctive 
      therapy for severe disease; attenuating ongoing sequelae (long COVID); and 
      immunisation support. Although some of these topics have not yet been 
      investigated in great depth concerning SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, extensive 
      research into the role of these vitamins in general respiratory infections has 
      highlighted directions for future research in the current pandemic.

AB  - PURPOSE: Musculoskeletal pain may occur after becoming infected with SARS-Cov2. 
      This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of mesotherapy in treating 
      chronic pain following COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A retrospective review was 
      conducted of the records of 96 patients with post-COVID pain syndrome. Those who 
      were eligible for oral therapy or mesotherapy, included in the study. Patients 
      receiving oral treatment with diclofenac potassium, thiocolchicoside and 
      cyanocobalamin were included in one group (n = 46), and patients receiving 
      intradermal mesotherapy with 2% lidocaine + cyanocobalamin were included in 
      another group (n = 50). The results of the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the 
      Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) were individually 
      assessed before and one week after the treatment. FINDINGS: The participants were 
      40.2 ± 11.1 years old on average. Of the participants, 35.4% (n = 34) were male 
      and 64.6% (n = 62) were female. Before treatment, there was no statistically 
      significant difference between the patients in terms of VAS and LANSS scores. 
      Following the treatment, a notable positive response was observed in both groups. 
      Nevertheless, when compared to the oral treatment group, the mesotherapy group 
      exhibited a more pronounced enhancement in VAS and LANSS scores (P < 0.001, P < 
      0.001, respectively). IMPLICATIONS: While both mesotherapy and oral therapy offer 
      benefits in reducing pain and alleviating neuropathic symptoms in post-COVID pain 
      syndrome, mesotherapy stands out as an especially effective and well-tolerated 
      treatment method, surpassing the efficacy of the oral alternative.

TI  - Isolated tracheobronchial mucormycosis: Report of a case and systematic review of 
      literature.
PG  - 5-12
LID - 10.1111/myc.13519 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isolated tracheobronchial mucormycosis (ITBM) is an uncommonly 
      reported entity. Herein, we report a case of ITBM following coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) and perform a systematic review of the literature. CASE 
      DESCRIPTION AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEW: A 45-year-old gentleman with poorly controlled 
      diabetes mellitus presented with cough, streaky haemoptysis, and hoarseness of 
      voice 2 weeks after mild COVID-19 illness. Computed tomography and flexible 
      bronchoscopy suggested the presence of a tracheal mass, which was spontaneously 
      expectorated. Histopathological examination of the mass confirmed invasive ITBM. 
      The patient had complete clinical and radiological resolution with glycaemic 
      control, posaconazole, and inhaled amphotericin B (8 weeks). Our systematic 
      review of the literature identified 25 additional cases of isolated airway 
      invasive mucormycosis. The median age of the 26 subjects (58.3% men) was 
      46 years. Diabetes mellitus (79.2%) was the most common risk factor. Uncommon 
      conditions such as anastomosis site mucormycosis (in two lung transplant 
      recipients), post-viral illness (post-COVID-19 [n = 3], and influenza [n = 1]), 
      and post-intubation mucormycosis (n = 1) were noted in a few. Three patients died 
      before treatment initiation. Systemic antifungals were used in most patients 
      (commonly amphotericin B). Inhalation (5/26; 19.2%) or bronchoscopic instillation 
      (1/26; 3.8%) of amphotericin B and surgery (6/26; 23.1%) were performed in some 
      patients. The case-fatality rate was 50%, primarily attributed to massive 
      haemoptysis. CONCLUSION: Isolated tracheobronchial mucormycosis is a rare 
      disease. Bronchoscopy helps in early diagnosis. Management with antifungals and 
      control of risk factors is required since surgery may not be feasible.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2-mediated dysregulation of metabolism and autophagy uncovers 
      host-targeting antivirals.

AB  - Viruses manipulate cellular metabolism and macromolecule recycling processes like 
      autophagy. Dysregulated metabolism might lead to excessive inflammatory and 
      autoimmune responses as observed in severe and long COVID-19 patients. Here we 
      show that SARS-CoV-2 modulates cellular metabolism and reduces autophagy. 
      Accordingly, compound-driven induction of autophagy limits SARS-CoV-2 
      propagation. In detail, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells show accumulation of key 
      metabolites, activation of autophagy inhibitors (AKT1, SKP2) and reduction of 
      proteins responsible for autophagy initiation (AMPK, TSC2, ULK1), membrane 
      nucleation, and phagophore formation (BECN1, VPS34, ATG14), as well as 
      autophagosome-lysosome fusion (BECN1, ATG14 oligomers). Consequently, 
      phagophore-incorporated autophagy markers LC3B-II and P62 accumulate, which we 
      confirm in a hamster model and lung samples of COVID-19 patients. Single-nucleus 
      and single-cell sequencing of patient-derived lung and mucosal samples show 
      differential transcriptional regulation of autophagy and immune genes depending 
      on cell type, disease duration, and SARS-CoV-2 replication levels. Targeting of 
      autophagic pathways by exogenous administration of the polyamines spermidine and 
      spermine, the selective AKT1 inhibitor MK-2206, and the BECN1-stabilizing 
      anthelmintic drug niclosamide inhibit SARS-CoV-2 propagation in vitro with IC(50) 
      values of 136.7, 7.67, 0.11, and 0.13 μM, respectively. Autophagy-inducing 
      compounds reduce SARS-CoV-2 propagation in primary human lung cells and 
      intestinal organoids emphasizing their potential as treatment options against 
      COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This is an investigation of the efficacy and safety of famotidine, a 
      selective histamine H2 receptor antagonist, on improvement of cognitive 
      impairment, depression and anxiety symptoms developing post-COVID-19, in a 
      12-week, randomized controlled trial. METHODS: A total of 50 patients with a 
      confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and a score ≤ 23 on the Mini-Mental State 
      Examination (MMSE) test or a score ≤ 22 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
      (MoCA) were randomly assigned to either the famotidine (40 mg twice daily) or the 
      placebo group. Changes in MMSE scores at weeks 6 and 12 were the primary outcome, 
      while changes in other scales were the secondary outcomes. Participants and 
      evaluators were blinded. RESULTS: At weeks 6 and 12, patients in the famotidine 
      group had significantly higher MMSE scores (p = 0.014, p < 0.001, respectively). 
      Regarding the MoCA scale, the famotidine group had a significantly higher score 
      at weeks 6 and 12 (p = 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). Considering the HAM-D 
      scale (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), at weeks 6 and 12, the famotidine group 
      experienced a larger reduction (p = 0.009, p = 0.02, respectively). Additionally, 
      comparison of the HAM-A scale scores (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) at weeks 6 
      and 12 showed a statistically significant larger reduction in the famotidine 
      group (p = 0.04, p = 0.02, respectively). The two groups did not differ in the 
      frequency of adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Our study supports safety and efficacy 
      of famotidine in treating cognitive impairment, depression and anxiety symptoms 
      induced by COVID-19. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered at the Iranian 
      registry of clinical trials (IRCT: www.irct.ir; registration number: 
      IRCT20090117001556N138).

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of data regarding the consequences of 
      ABO-incompatible kidney transplant (ABOiKTx) among post-COVID-19 candidates. 
      METHODS: The study was designed as a retrospective, multicentric cohort study 
      across 11 sites in India, from August 2020 to December 2021. The data for ABOiKTx 
      conducted for post-COVID-19 candidates were investigated. The primary outcome of 
      biopsy-proven acute rejection was compared with the ABO protocol implemented 
      through Kaplan-Meier analysis. The secondary outcomes were graft loss, patient 
      survival, and infections. RESULTS: A total of 38 ABOiKTx with candidates of 
      median (interquartile range) age of 38.5 (31.25-47.5) years were performed. 
      Nineteen cases had mild COVID-19 severity, while 9 cases (23.6%) had an oxygen 
      requirement. Six (15.7%) donors also were post-COVID-19. The most common ABO 
      incompatibility reported was A to O in 14 (36.8%) pairs followed by B to O in 10 
      (26.3%) pairs. The maximum isoagglutinin titer cutoff was 1:2048 and 1:64 for 
      baseline and pretransplant levels, respectively. The median time from COVID-19 
      infection to surgery was 130 (63.2-183) days. Biopsy-proven acute rejection, 
      graft loss, and mortality were 13.1%, 2.6%, and 2.6%, respectively. The 
      Breslow-Wilcoxon's P value in Kaplan-Meier plots were 0.57 and 0.93 for 
      thymoglobulin-based induction and high dose rituximab-based regimen, 
      respectively. The incidence of reinfection was 2.6%. Two (5.2%) urinary tract 
      infections were reported. No cytomegalovirus or BK polyomavirus infection was 
      reported. The median serum creatinine at 1 year of follow-up was 1.1 (0.8-1.3) 
      mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Our report implies that ABOiKTx in post-COVID-19 candidates 
      can be successfully performed with no major deviation from standard ABO protocol.

TI  - Efficacy of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir for post-acute COVID-19 sequelae beyond 3 
      months of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
PG  - e28750
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28750 [doi]
AB  - The effect of nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (NMV-r) on post-acute COVID-19 sequelae 
      beyond 3 months of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. This retrospective 
      cohort study utilized data from the TriNetX Research Network. We identified 
      nonhospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 receiving a diagnosis between 
      January 1 and July 31, 2022. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to create 
      two matched cohorts: NMV-r and non-NMV-r groups, respectively. We measured the 
      primary outcomes using a composite of all-cause emergency room (ER) visits or 
      hospitalization and a composite of post-COVID-19 symptoms according to the WHO 
      Delphi consensus, which also stated that post COVID-19 condition occurs usually 3 
      months from the onset of COVID-19, during the follow-up period between 90 days 
      after the index diagnosis of COVID-19 and the end of follow-up (180 days). 
      Initially, we identified 12 247 patients that received NMV-r within 5 days of 
      diagnosis and 465 135 that did not. After PSM, 12 245 patients remained in each 
      group. During the follow-up period, patients treated with NMV-r had a lower risk 
      of all-cause hospitalization and ER visits compared with untreated patients (659 
      vs. 955; odds ratio [OR], 0.672; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.607-0.745; 
      p < 0.0001). However, the overall risk of post-acute COVID-19 symptoms did not 
      significantly differ between the two groups (2265 vs. 2187; OR, 1.043; 95% CI, 
      0.978-1.114; p = 0.2021). The reduced risk of all-cause ER visits or 
      hospitalization in the NMV-r group and the similarities in the risk of post-acute 
      COVID-19 symptoms between the two groups were consistent in the subgroups 
      stratified by sex, age, and vaccination status. Early NMV-r treatment of 
      nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 was associated with reduced risk of 
      hospitalization and ER visits during the period of 90-180 days after diagnosis 
      compared with no NMV-r treatment; however, post-acute COVID-19 symptoms and 
      mortality risk did not differ significantly between the groups.

TI  - Proteomics of fibrin amyloid microclots in long COVID/post-acute sequelae of 
      COVID-19 (PASC) shows many entrapped pro-inflammatory molecules that may also 
      contribute to a failed fibrinolytic system.
PG  - 190

LID - 190
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also now known as long COVID, 
      has become a major global health and economic burden. Previously, we provided 
      evidence that there is a significant insoluble fibrin amyloid microclot load in 
      the circulation of individuals with long COVID, and that these microclots entrap 
      a substantial number of inflammatory molecules, including those that might 
      prevent clot breakdown. Scientifically, the most challenging aspect of this 
      debilitating condition is that traditional pathology tests such as a serum CRP 
      (C-reactive protein) may not show any significant abnormal inflammatory markers, 
      albeit these tests measure only the soluble inflammatory molecules. Elevated, or 
      abnormal soluble biomarkers such as IL-6, D-Dimer or fibrinogen indicate an 
      increased risk for thrombosis or a host immune response in COVID-19. The absence 
      of biomarkers in standard pathology tests, result in a significant amount of 
      confusion for patients and clinicians, as patients are extremely sick or even 
      bed-ridden but with no regular identifiable reason for their disease. Biomarkers 
      that are currently available cannot detect the molecules present in the 
      microclots we identified and are therefore unable to confirm their presence or 
      the mechanisms that drive their formation. METHODS: Here we analysed the protein 
      content of double-digested microclots of 99 long COVID patients and 29 healthy 
      controls. The patients suffering from long COVID reported their symptoms through 
      a questionnaire completed by themselves or their attending physician. RESULTS: 
      Our long COVID cohort's symptoms were found to be in line with global findings, 
      where the most prevalent symptoms were constant fatigue (74%,) cognitive 
      impairment (71%) and depression and anxiety (30%). Our most noteworthy findings 
      were a reduced level of plasma Kallikrein compared to our controls, an increased 
      level of platelet factor 4 (PF4) von Willebrand factor (VWF), and a marginally 
      increased level of α-2 antiplasmin (α-2-AP). We also found a significant presence 
      of antibodies entrapped inside these microclots. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm 
      the presence of pro-inflammatory molecules that may also contribute to a failed 
      fibrinolysis phenomenon, which could possibly explain why individuals with long 
      COVID suffer from chronic fatigue, dyspnoea, or cognitive impairment. In 
      addition, significant platelet hyperactivation was noted. Hyperactivation will 
      result in the granular content of platelets being shed into the circulation, 
      including PF4. Overall, our results provide further evidence of both a failed 
      fibrinolytic system in long COVID/PASC and the entrapment of many proteins whose 
      presence might otherwise go unrecorded. These findings might have significant 
      implications for individuals with pre-existing comorbidities, including 
      cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the frequency of long-COVID in patients with chronic 
      cerebrovascular disease, to identify the risk factors for the development of this 
      condition and to analyze effectiveness and tolerability of Vinpocetine and Aertal 
      in treatment of this disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 97 
      patients (64.5±5.2 years), among which 42 were diagnosed with long-COVID. The 
      effectiveness of treatment was analyzed with NRS-P, Post-COVID-19 Functional 
      Status (PCFS), Global Rating of Change Scale (GROC). RESULTS: Predictors of 
      long-COVID was female gender (p=0.022), severe COVID-19 (p=0.035), comorbidities: 
      cardiovascular diseases (p=0.032), endocrinopathies (p=0.041), affective 
      disorders (p=0.021). Significant changes in the functional status of patients 
      were recorded after 20 days of treatment (PCFS), in pain after 10 days (NRS-P). 
      The most pronounced clinical effect (PCFS) was obtained after 1 mth of therapy 
      with vinpocetine and 20 days with aceclofenac (NRS-P). After 30 days 25/59.5% of 
      patients noted a «pronounced» improvement in their own well-being (GROC) without 
      the development of significant side effects. CONCLUSIONS: 43.3% of patients with 
      chronic cerebrovascular disease and certain predictors develop long-COVID. 
      Aceclofenac and vinpocetine are effective in relieving a number of symptoms of 
      long-COVID, which requires further study.

TI  - Diagnostic and Pharmacological Potency of Creatine in Post-Viral Fatigue 
      Syndrome.
LID - 10.3390/nu13020503 [doi]
LID - 503
AB  - Post-viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS) is a widespread chronic neurological disease 
      with no definite etiological factor(s), no actual diagnostic test, and no 
      approved pharmacological treatment, therapy, or cure. Among other features, PVFS 
      could be accompanied by various irregularities in creatine metabolism, perturbing 
      either tissue levels of creatine in the brain, the rates of phosphocreatine 
      resynthesis in the skeletal muscle, or the concentrations of the enzyme creatine 
      kinase in the blood. Furthermore, supplemental creatine and related guanidino 
      compounds appear to impact both patient- and clinician-reported outcomes in 
      syndromes and maladies with chronic fatigue. This paper critically overviews the 
      most common disturbances in creatine metabolism in various PVFS populations, 
      summarizes human trials on dietary creatine and creatine analogs in the syndrome, 
      and discusses new frontiers and open questions for using creatine in a 
      post-COVID-19 world.

TI  - Multi-target drugs for the treatment of cognitive impairment and fatigue in 
      post-COVID syndrome: focus on Ginkgo biloba and Rhodiola rosea.
PG  - 203-212
LID - 10.1007/s00702-024-02749-3 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive impairment, depression and (mental) fatigue represent the most frequent 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms of the post-COVID syndrome. Neuroinflammation, 
      oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been identified as common 
      pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these symptoms. Attempts to treat 
      post-COVID-associated cognitive impairment and fatigue with different drugs 
      available for other diseases have not yet been successful. One probable 
      explanation could be that these drugs work by one specific mechanism of action 
      only and not in a broad multi-target way. Therefore, they will not address the 
      broad pathophysiological spectrum possibly responsible for cognitive impairment, 
      depression and fatigue in post-COVID syndrome. Notably, nearly all drugs 
      currently under investigation for fatigue in post-COVID syndrome are rather 
      addressing one single target instead of the several pathomechanisms underlying 
      this condition. Contrary to this approach, herbal drugs often consist of many 
      different ingredients with different pharmacological properties and 
      pharmacological targets. Therefore, these drugs might be a promising approach for 
      the treatment of the broad symptomatic presentation and the pathophysiological 
      mechanisms of cognitive impairment and fatigue following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
      Of these herbal drugs, extracts of Ginkgo biloba and Rhodiola rosea probably are 
      the best investigated candidates. Their broad pharmacological spectrum in vitro 
      and in vivo includes anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant as well as 
      properties reducing cognitive impairment and fatigue. In several studies, both 
      drugs showed positive effects on physical and mental fatigue and impaired 
      cognition. Moreover, depressive symptoms were also reduced in some studies. 
      However, even if these results are promising, the data are still preliminary and 
      require additional proof by further studies.

TI  - Effects of l-Arginine Plus Vitamin C Supplementation on Physical Performance, 
      Endothelial Function, and Persistent Fatigue in Adults with Long COVID: A 
      Single-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/nu14234984 [doi]
LID - 4984
AB  - Long COVID, a condition characterized by symptom and/or sign persistence 
      following an acute COVID-19 episode, is associated with reduced physical 
      performance and endothelial dysfunction. Supplementation of l-arginine may 
      improve endothelial and muscle function by stimulating nitric oxide synthesis. A 
      single-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in adults aged 
      between 20 and 60 years with persistent fatigue attending a post-acute COVID-19 
      outpatient clinic. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive twice-daily orally 
      either a combination of 1.66 g l-arginine plus 500 mg liposomal vitamin C or a 
      placebo for 28 days. The primary outcome was the distance walked on the 6 min 
      walk test. Secondary outcomes were handgrip strength, flow-mediated dilation, and 
      fatigue persistence. Fifty participants were randomized to receive either 
      l-arginine plus vitamin C or a placebo. Forty-six participants (median 
      (interquartile range) age 51 (14), 30 [65%] women), 23 per group, received the 
      intervention to which they were allocated and completed the study. At 28 days, 
      l-arginine plus vitamin C increased the 6 min walk distance (+30 (40.5) m; 
      placebo: +0 (75) m, p = 0.001) and induced a greater improvement in handgrip 
      strength (+3.4 (7.5) kg) compared with the placebo (+1 (6.6) kg, p = 0.03). The 
      flow-mediated dilation was greater in the active group than in the placebo (14.3% 
      (7.3) vs. 9.4% (5.8), p = 0.03). At 28 days, fatigue was reported by two 
      participants in the active group (8.7%) and 21 in the placebo group (80.1%; p < 
      0.0001). l-arginine plus vitamin C supplementation improved walking performance, 
      muscle strength, endothelial function, and fatigue in adults with long COVID. 
      This supplement may, therefore, be considered to restore physical performance and 
      relieve persistent symptoms in this patient population.

TI  - Take home injectable opioids for opioid use disorder during and after the 
      COVID-19 Pandemic is in urgent need: a case study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In North America the opioid poisoning crisis currently faces the 
      unprecedented challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, further straining 
      people and communities already facing structural and individual vulnerabilities. 
      People with opioid use disorder (OUD) are facing unique challenges in response to 
      COVID-19, such as not being able to adopt best practices (e.g., physical 
      distancing) if they're financially insecure or living in shelters (or homeless). 
      They also have other medical conditions that make them more likely to be 
      immunocompromised and at risk of developing COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 
      public health emergency, national and provincial regulatory bodies introduced 
      guidance and exemptions to mitigate the spread of the virus. Among them, clinical 
      guidance for prescribers were issued to allow take home opioid medications for 
      opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Take Home for injectable opioid agonist treatment 
      (iOAT) is only considered within a restrictive regulatory structure, specific to 
      the pandemic. Nevertheless, this risk mitigation guidance allowed carries, mostly 
      daily dispensed, to a population that would not have access to it prior to the 
      pandemic. In this case it is presented and discussed that if a carry was possible 
      during the pandemic, then the carry could continue post COVID-19 to address a gap 
      in our approach to individualize care for people with OUD receiving iOAT. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: Here we present the first case of a patient in Canada with 
      long-term OUD that received take home injectable diacetylmorphine to self-isolate 
      in an approved site after being diagnosed with COVID-19 during a visit to the 
      emergency room where he was diagnosed with cellulitis and admitted to receive 
      antibiotics. CONCLUSION: In the present case we demonstrated that it is feasible 
      to provide iOAT outside the community clinic with no apparent negative 
      consequences. Improving upon and making permanent these recently introduced risk 
      mitigating guidance during COVID-19, have the potential not just to protect 
      during the pandemic, but also to address long-overdue barriers to access 
      evidence-based care in addiction treatment.

TI  - Post-Coronavirus Disease-2019 Rhino-orbital Mucormycosis: A Case Report.
PG  - 108-115
LID - 10.3126/nepjoph.v15i2.46954 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) is a rare, opportunistic, 
      angio-invasive, and fatal infection caused by mold fungi of the genera Rhizopus, 
      Mucor, and Rhizomucor. The global incidence of ROCM is 0.005-1.7 per million, 
      with a fatality rate of 46%. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for this 
      disease, as a delay of one week can increase the mortality rate to 66%. CASE: A 
      32-year-old male, a known case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for the 
      past 15 days from Janakpur, Dhanusha, Nepal presented to the emergency department 
      of Dhulikhel Hospital with a sudden onset of blurred vision in the left eye, 
      left-sided ocular pain, and nasal bleeding for the last three days. OBSERVATIONS: 
      The patient was suspected of post-COVID-19 mucormycosis, and a nasal swab for 
      potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount showed hyphae in microscopy. Intravenous and 
      retrobulbar liposomal amphotericin B were administered as medical therapy, along 
      with surgical debridement. A multidisciplinary approach was necessary for the 
      treatment. CONCLUSION: A long-term, multimodal treatment approach involving 
      combined antifungal drug therapy (intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and 
      retrobulbar amphotericin B), and timely surgical debridement leads to an 
      improvement in both short-term and long-term outcomes.

TI  - Selenium, selenoprotein P, and oxidative stress levels in SARS-CoV-2 patients 
      during illness and recovery.
PG  - 499-503
LID - 10.1007/s10787-022-00925-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess tendency of oxidative stress in COVID-19 
      patients depending on severity. METHODS: The study was conducted with 80 
      post-COVID-19 disease patients and 40 acutely ill patients. Content of selenium 
      in blood plasma was detected by a fluorimetric method with di-amino-naphthalene 
      using acidic hydrolysis. Selenoprotein P, malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal 
      and their metabolite adducts were evaluated by spectrophotometric methods using 
      commercial assay kits. RESULTS: Obtained results showed that selenium content in 
      blood for post-COVID-19 disease patients was of a similar lower norm for Latvian 
      inhabitants. Selenium and seleno-protein P contents for acute patients were 
      significantly decreased compared with post-COVID-19 disease patients. CONCLUSION: 
      In conclusion, COVID-19 involves induction of antioxidant systems-in case of 
      severe disease, patients have significantly low concentration of selenium, 
      seleno-protein P and higher level of oxidative stress, which, in turn, confirms 
      the more intense formation of free radicals in the body.

TI  - Is antiviral treatment at the acute phase of COVID-19 effective for decreasing 
      the risk of long-COVID? A systematic review.
PG  - 43-58
LID - 10.1007/s15010-023-02154-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Preliminary evidence suggests a potential effect of antiviral medication 
      used during the acute COVID-19 phase for preventing long-COVID. This review 
      investigates if having received pharmacological treatment during acute SARS-CoV-2 
      infection may reduce the risk of long-COVID. METHODS: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, 
      EMBASE, Web of Science databases, as well as medRxiv/bioRxiv preprint servers 
      were searched up to July 15th, 2023. Articles comparing the presence of 
      long-COVID symptoms between individuals who received or not a specific 
      medication, particularly antivirals, during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the 
      Newcastle-Ottawa Scale or Cochrane's Risk of Bias (Rob) tool. RESULTS: From 517 
      studies identified, 6 peer-reviewed studies and one preprint met all inclusion 
      criteria. The sample included 2683 (n = 4) hospitalized COVID-19 survivors and 
      307,409 (n = 3) non-hospitalized patients. The methodological quality was high in 
      71% of studies (n = 5/7). Two studies investigating the effects of 
      Nirmaltrevir/Ritonavir and three studies the effect of Remdesivir reported 
      conflicting results on effectiveness for preventing long-COVID. Three studies 
      investigating the effects of other medication such as Dexamethasone (n = 2) or 
      Metformin (n = 1) found positive results of these medications for preventing 
      long-COVID. CONCLUSION: Available evidence about the effect of medication 
      treatment with antivirals during acute COVID-19 and reduced risk of developing 
      long-COVID is conflicting. Heterogeneous evidence suggests that Remdesivir or 
      Nirmaltrevir/Ritonavir could have a potential protective effect for long-COVID. A 
      limited number of studies demonstrated a potential benefit of other medications 
      such as Dexamethasone or Metformin, but more studies are needed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent evidence suggests that oxidative stress and endothelial 
      dysfunction play critical roles in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and 
      Long-COVID. We hypothesized that a supplementation combining L-Arginine (to 
      improve endothelial function) and Vitamin C (to reduce oxidation) could have 
      favorable effects on Long-COVID symptoms. METHODS: We designed a survey (LINCOLN: 
      L-Arginine and Vitamin C improves Long-COVID), assessing several symptoms that 
      have been associated with Long-COVID to be administered nationwide to COVID-19 
      survivors; the survey also included effort perception, measured using the Borg 
      scale. Patients receiving the survey were divided in two groups, with a 2:1 
      ratio: the first group included patients that received L-Arginine + Vitamin C, 
      whereas the second group received a multivitamin combination (alternative 
      treatment). RESULTS: 1390 patients successfully completed the survey. Following a 
      30-day treatment in both groups, the survey revealed that patients in the 
      L-Arginine + Vitamin C treatment arm had significantly lower scores compared to 
      patients who had received the multivitamin combination. There were no other 
      significant differences between the two groups. When examining effort perception, 
      we observed a significantly lower value (p < 0.0001) in patients receiving 
      L-Arginine + Vitamin C compared to the alternative-treatment arm. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our survey indicates that the supplementation with L-Arginine + Vitamin C has 
      beneficial effects in Long-COVID, in terms of attenuating its typical symptoms 
      and improving effort perception.

      post-COVID-19 syndrome.
PG  - 89-96
LID - 10.4149/BLL_2023_013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with inflammation, decrease in 
      antioxidants and oxidative damage. We aimed to investigate whether ubiquinol, 
      reduced form of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), with mountain spa rehabilitation (MR) will 
      contribute to recovering of patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome. METHODS: The 
      study included 36 patients on MR lasting 16-18 days. Twenty‑two patients were 
      supplemented with ubiquinol 2x100 mg/day (MRQ), 14 underwent MR without 
      supplementation. The control group consisted of 15 healthy volunteers. 
      Concentrations of total CoQ10 (ubiquinone + ubiquinol), α- and γ-tocopherol were 
      determined in platelets (PLT), in blood and plasma, also β-carotene was 
      determined. Plasma concentration of thiobarbituric acid‑reactive substances 
      (TBARS) was used as the oxidative stress marker. Clinical symptoms were evaluated 
      by questionnaire. RESULTS: MRQ group showed a significant increase in CoQ10, 
      namely in PLT by 68 %, in blood by 194 %, and in plasma by 232 %. In MR group, 
      CoQ10 stayed unchanged. In both groups, the initially increased concentrations of 
      tocopherols in PLT returned nearly to the control values. β-carotene levels 
      decreased in both groups while TBARS decreased slightly in the MRQ group. More 
      clinical symptoms disappeared in the MRQ group. CONCLUSION: Accelerated recovery 
      of patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome was proven after mountain spa 
      rehabilitation and ubiquinol supplementation. Increased systemic and cellular 
      CoQ10 concentration alleviated clinical symptoms and improved antioxidant 
      protection of the patients. We draw attention to the importance of monitoring and 
      ensuring adequate levels of CoQ10 in post-COVID-19 syndrome (Tab. 2, Fig. 1, Ref. 
      45). Text in PDF www.elis.sk Keywords: COVID-19, mountain spa rehabilitation,

TI  - Effects of Losartan on Patients Hospitalized for Acute COVID-19: A Randomized 
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - 615-625
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciae306 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      down-regulates angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, potentially increasing 
      angiotensin II. We hypothesized that losartan compared to usual care decreases 
      mortality and is safe in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19). We aimed to evaluate the effect of losartan versus usual care on 
      28-day mortality in patients hospitalized for acute COVID-19. METHODS: 
      Eligibility criteria included adults admitted for acute COVID-19. Exclusion 
      criteria were hypotension, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, and use of 
      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
      within 7 days. Participants were randomized to losartan 25-100 mg/day orally for 
      the hospital duration or 3 months or the control arm (usual care) in 29 hospitals 
      in Canada and France. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary 
      outcomes were hospital mortality, organ support, and serious adverse events 
      (SAEs). RESULTS: The trial was stopped early because of a serious safety concern 
      with losartan. In 341 patients, any SAE and hypotension were significantly higher 
      in the losartan versus usual care groups (any SAE: 39.8% vs 27.2%, respectively, 
      P = .01; hypotension: 30.4% vs 15.3%, respectively, P < .001) in both ward and 
      intensive care patients. The 28-day mortality did not differ between losartan 
      (6.5%) versus usual care (5.9%) (odds ratio, 1.11 [95% confidence interval, 
      .47-2.64]; P = .81), nor did organ dysfunction or secondary outcomes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Caution is needed in deciding which patients to start or continue 
      using ARBs in patients hospitalized with pneumonia to mitigate risk of 
      hypotension, acute kidney injury, and other side effects. ARBs should not be 
      added to care of patients hospitalized for acute COVID-19. CLINICAL TRIALS 
      REGISTRATION: NCT04606563.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-COVID-19 syndrome, characterized by persistent symptoms such as 
      fatigue, dyspnea, cough, insomnia, and exercise intolerance, poses a significant 
      challenge to global healthcare systems. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has 
      been used to manage post-viral syndromes, but high-quality evidence for its 
      effectiveness in post-COVID-19 recovery is limited. This study aimed to evaluate 
      the clinical efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in treating 
      post-COVID-19 syndrome through a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Five electronic databases (PubMed, 
      Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and CNKI) were systematically searched 
      up to March 15, 2025. RCTs comparing CHM with placebo or usual care in patients 
      with confirmed post-COVID-19 syndrome were included. Primary outcomes were 
      symptom severity measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); secondary outcomes 
      included relief rates of cough, fatigue, chest tightness, dyspnea, insomnia, and 
      exercise intolerance. Data were pooled using a random-effects model, and 
      heterogeneity was assessed using I(2) statistics. RESULTS: Ten RCTs involving 
      2401 patients were included. CHM showed a greater reduction in VAS scores 
      compared to controls (MD = -1.03; 95% CI -2.10 to 0.03; P = 0.0577), with higher 
      heterogeneity (I(2) = 92%). Although this result did not reach conventional 
      statistical significance, it suggests a potentially meaningful clinical trend 
      favoring CHM. Subgroup analysis indicated both short-term and long-term CHM 
      treatments improved VAS scores, with a stronger effect in long-term treatment. 
      CHM significantly improved chest tightness (RR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.21-1.61; 
      P < 0.0001; I(2) = 0%) and insomnia (RR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.03-1.47; P = 0.0216; 
      I(2) = 0%). A trend toward improvement was observed in fatigue (RR = 1.58, 95% CI 
      0.95-2.64; P = 0.0781) and dyspnea (RR = 1.39, 95% CI 0.99-1.95; P = 0.0554), 
      although these results did not reach statistical significance. No significant 
      difference was observed in terms of 6-min walking distance (MD = 13.95 m, 95% CI 
      -11.64 to 39.55; P = 0.2853). Adverse event rates were comparable between the 
      herbal and control groups (RR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.49-1.07; P = 0.1052). CONCLUSIONS: 
      This meta-analysis indicates that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) may help 
      relieve certain post-COVID-19 symptoms, especially chest tightness and insomnia. 
      Trends toward benefit were also noted for fatigue and dyspnea, though without 
      statistical significance. Given the non-significant VAS results and high 
      heterogeneity, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. Further 
      large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to validate these outcomes and 
      optimize treatment strategies. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION:

TI  - A prospective follow-up on thyroid function, thyroid autoimmunity and long COVID 
      among 250 COVID-19 survivors.
PG  - 380-391
LID - 10.1007/s12020-022-03281-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the evolution of thyroid function and autoimmunity among 
      COVID-19 survivors over 6 months in relation to interferon beta-1b treatment and 
      long COVID. METHODS: We included COVID-19 survivors managed in a major COVID-19 
      centre between July 2020 and May 2021 who were reassessed three and/or six months 
      after acute COVID-19. Thyroid function tests (TFTs) and anti-thyroid antibody 
      titres were measured at acute COVID-19, 3-month and 6-month. RESULTS: 250 
      COVID-19 survivors were included (mean age 52.7 years, 50.4% men). Persistent 
      thyroid function abnormalities were more likely in those with abnormal TFTs in 
      acute COVID-19 (P < 0.001). Among 51 patients with abnormal TFTs in acute 
      COVID-19, 82.4% resolved upon follow-up. Of 199 patients with normal TFTs in 
      acute COVID-19, only 4.5% had incident abnormal TFTs, more likely in 
      interferon-treated patients (P = 0.044) and none clinically overt. Among 129 
      patients with complete 6-month follow-up for anti-thyroid antibody titres, there 
      was no significant change overall, except for modest increase in anti-thyroid 
      antibody titres among the 84 interferon-treated patients (P < 0.05 at both 3 
      months and 6 months). Long COVID occurred in 19.5% and 10.4% at 3 and 6 months 
      respectively, where TFTs and anti-thyroid antibody titres were not predictive of 
      its occurrence. CONCLUSION: Over 6 months, most abnormal TFTs in acute COVID-19 
      resolved, with no significant incident thyroid dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      did not lead to change in thyroid autoimmunity, while interferon treatment was 
      associated with modest increase in anti-thyroid antibody titres. Thyroid function 
      and anti-thyroid antibodies did not play a significant role in long COVID.

TI  - Targeting Neuroinflammation to Alleviate Chronic Olfactory Dysfunction in Long 
      COVID: A Role for Investigating Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT)?
LID - 10.3390/life13010226 [doi]
LID - 226
AB  - Chronic olfactory dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs in approximately 
      10% of patients with COVID-19-induced anosmia, and it is a growing public health 
      concern. A regimen of olfactory training and anti-neuroinflammatory therapy with 
      co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide with luteolin (um-PEA-LUT) has shown 
      promising results in clinical trials; however, approximately 15% of treated 
      patients do not achieve full recovery of a normal olfactory threshold, and almost 
      5% have no recovery. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), which are used to treat 
      autoimmune neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis (MS), have not been studied 
      for treating persistent inflammation in refractory post-COVID-19 smell disorder. 
      This study evaluated COVID-19-related smell loss and MS-related smell loss, 
      comparing the responses to different therapies. Forty patients with MS and 45 
      reporting post-COVID-19 olfactory disorders were included in the study. All 
      patients underwent nasal endoscopy and were evaluated by using validated Sniffin' 
      Sticks testing. The patients with long COVID were treated for three months with 
      um-PEA-LUT plus olfactory training. The patients with MS were treated with DMTs. 
      Olfactory functions before and after treatment were analyzed in both groups. At 
      the experimental endpoint, 13 patients in the COVID-19 group treated with 
      um-PEA-LUT had residual olfactory impairment versus 10 patients in the MS group 
      treated with DMTs. The severity of the persistent olfactory loss was lower in the 
      MS group, and the patients with MS treated with IFN-beta and glatiramer acetate 
      had the preservation of olfactory function. These data provide a rationale for 
      considering prospective trials investigating the efficacy of DMTs for 
      post-COVID-19 olfactory disorders that are refractory to um-PEA-LUT with 
      olfactory training. This study is the first to consider the role of DMT in 
      treating refractory post-viral olfactory loss in patients with long COVID.

TI  - A mid‑pandemic night's dream: Melatonin, from harbinger of anti‑inflammation to 
      mitochondrial savior in acute and long COVID‑19 (Review).

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), a systemic illness caused by severe acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), has triggered a worldwide pandemic 
      with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to chronic, affecting practically every 
      organ. Melatonin, an ancient antioxidant found in all living organisms, has been 
      suggested as a safe and effective therapeutic option for the treatment of 
      SARS‑CoV‑2 infection due to its good safety characteristics and broad‑spectrum 
      antiviral medication properties. Melatonin is essential in various metabolic 
      pathways and governs physiological processes, such as the sleep‑wake cycle and 
      circadian rhythms. It exhibits oncostatic, anti‑inflammatory, antioxidant and 
      anti‑aging properties, exhibiting promise for use in the treatment of numerous 
      disorders, including COVID‑19. The preventive and therapeutic effects of 
      melatonin have been widely explored in a number of conditions and have been 
      well‑established in experimental ischemia/reperfusion investigations, 
      particularly in coronary heart disease and stroke. Clinical research evaluating 
      the use of melatonin in COVID‑19 has shown various improved outcomes, including 
      reduced hospitalization durations; however, the trials are small. Melatonin can 
      alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction in COVID‑19, improve immune cell function and 
      provide antioxidant properties. However, its therapeutic potential remains 
      underexplored due to funding limitations and thus further investigations are 
      required.

      disorder.
PG  - 456-463

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To learn how preferences and practices regarding telehealth have 
      evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic for physicians who provide opioid use 
      disorder (OUD) treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Publicly registered physicians who 
      provide OUD treatment were surveyed on their current and retrospective use of 
      telehealth and how their perception of telehealth effectiveness and policy 
      preferences have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic as telehealth regulations 
      were loosened throughout the country. METHODS: The primary survey data were 
      collected in July 2020 leveraging administrative contact information for the 
      population of publicly listed buprenorphine-prescribing physicians in the United 
      States. A total of 1141 physicians received the survey and consented to 
      participate. RESULTS: Many surveyed physicians used telehealth for the first time 
      during the early COVID-19 era (29% pre-COVID-19 use rate increased to 66%). Most 
      respondents found telehealth to be more effective than expected (54% vs 16% who 
      found it less effective), 85% were in favor of the temporary telehealth 
      flexibility being permanently extended, and 77% would be likely to use telehealth 
      after the COVID-19 pandemic, regulations permitting. Imputation exercises that 
      leverage the linked survey and administrative data suggest that the findings are 
      unlikely to be driven by nonrandom survey participation. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians 
      were asked about their OUD telehealth policy preferences. Findings suggest that 
      the COVID-19 pandemic increased physician respondent use of telehealth 
      technology, and this has positively shifted their perceptions of effectiveness. 
      Respondents overwhelmingly report interest in post-COVID-19 pandemic telehealth 
      use and support for proposed legislation to loosen telehealth restrictions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A large proportion of individuals who have recovered from an acute 
      COVID-19 infection continue to experience symptoms months later. Post-acute 
      COVID-19 (long-haul COVID-19) can range from serious complications to quality of 
      life symptoms such as fatigue or insomnia. The purpose of this study was to 
      evaluate the potential for inhalation of essential oils to improve energy levels 
      among otherwise healthy female survivors of acute COVID-19 who experience a lack 
      of energy more than five months after recovery. This study was conducted in the 
      United States in late 2021. METHOD: This was a randomized double blind, placebo 
      controlled trial to evaluate the potential for inhalation of Longevity™, a 
      proprietary essential oil blend manufactured by Young Living Essential Oils 
      (Lehi, Utah, USA), on energy levels among female survivors of COVID-19 who 
      continue to experience fatigue more than 5 months recovery from the acute 
      infection. Forty women were randomized to two groups: intervention and placebo. 
      Both groups inhaled the assigned product twice daily for fourteen consecutive 
      days. Fatigue scores were measured using the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom 
      Inventory (MFSI). Secondary outcomes included scores on each of the MFSI's ten 
      subscales. RESULTS: Individuals who inhaled the essential oil blend for 2 weeks 
      had significantly lower fatigue scores after controlling for baseline scores, 
      employment status, BMI, olfactory function, and time since diagnosis, with a 
      large effect size (F (1,39) = 6.15, p = .020, partial eta squared = 0.198). 
      Subscale analysis identified subscales of vigor, as well as global, behavioral, 
      general, and mental fatigue as benefiting from the intervention. This study 
      provides evidence that a proprietary aromatherapy blend can significantly improve 
      energy levels among women who are experiencing fatigue after recovering from 
      COVID-19.

TI  - Pericarditis after SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Another Pebble in the Mosaic of Long 
      COVID?
LID - 10.3390/v13101997 [doi]
LID - 1997
AB  - With the emerging success of the COVID-19 vaccination programs, the incidence of 
      acute COVID-19 will decrease. However, given the high number of people who 
      contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovered, we will be faced with a 
      significant number of patients with persistent symptoms even months after their 
      COVID-19 infection. In this setting, long COVID and its cardiovascular 
      manifestations, including pericarditis, need to become a top priority for 
      healthcare systems as a new chronic disease process. Concerning the relationship 
      between COVID-19 and pericardial diseases, pericarditis appears to be common in 
      the acute infection but rare in the postacute period, while small pericardial 
      effusions may be relatively common in the postacute period of COVID-19. Here, we 
      reported a series of 7 patients developing pericarditis after a median of 20 days 
      from clinical and virological recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. We excluded 
      specific identifiable causes of pericarditis, hence we speculate that these cases 
      can be contextualized within the clinical spectrum of long COVID. All our 
      patients were treated with a combination of colchicine and either ASA or NSAIDs, 
      but four of them did not achieve a clinical response. When switched to 
      glucocorticoids, these four patients recovered with no recurrence during drug 
      tapering. Based on this observation and on the latency of pericarditis occurrence 
      (a median of 20 days after a negative nasopharyngeal swab), could be suggested 
      that post-COVID pericarditis may be linked to ongoing inflammation sustained by 
      the persistence of viral nucleic acid without virus replication in the 
      pericardium. Therefore, glucocorticoids may be a suitable treatment option in 
      patients not responding or intolerant to conventional therapy and who require to 
      counteract the pericardial inflammatory component rather than direct an acute 
      viral injury to the pericardial tissue.

AB  - With expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of post-COVID-19 interstitial 
      lung disease (ILD) have been emerging. However, there are few reports regarding 
      treatment. Some reports indicate that corticosteroids are effective for 
      post-COVID-19 ILD, but the use of long-term corticosteroid carries risks of side 
      effects. We administered tacrolimus to an elderly patient with post-COVID-19 ILD 
      who suffered a respiratory failure relapse during steroid tapering. The 
      respiratory status improved with tacrolimus in the post-acute phase, but 
      pulmonary fibrosis progressed in the late phase. Tacrolimus may be effective for 
      treating post-COVID-19 ILD in the post-acute phase, but it does not halt 
      progression of pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Nocardiosis is an acute, subacute or chronic infectious disease that occurs in 
      cutaneous, pulmonary and disseminated forms. We present a case of Nocardiosis in 
      a post-COVID-19 patient with cutaneous ulceration due to Nocardia 
      otitidiscaviarum, managed with cotrimoxazole and linezolid. Early diagnosis and 
      management proved crucial in preventing dissemination of the organism and 
      improving the patient's outcome.

TI  - Possible Role of Cannabis in the Management of Neuroinflammation in Patients with 
      Post-COVID Condition.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25073805 [doi]
LID - 3805
AB  - The post-COVID condition (PCC) is a pathology stemming from COVID-19, and 
      studying its pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment is crucial. 
      Neuroinflammation causes the most common manifestations of this disease including 
      headaches, fatigue, insomnia, depression, anxiety, among others. Currently, there 
      are no specific management proposals; however, given that the inflammatory 
      component involves cytokines and free radicals, these conditions must be treated 
      to reduce the current symptoms and provide neuroprotection to reduce the risk of 
      a long-term neurodegenerative disease. It has been shown that cannabis has 
      compounds with immunomodulatory and antioxidant functions in other pathologies. 
      Therefore, exploring this approach could provide a viable therapeutic option for 
      PCC, which is the purpose of this review. This review involved an exhaustive 
      search in specialized databases including PubMed, PubChem, ProQuest, EBSCO, 
      Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Clinical Trials. Phytocannabinoids, 
      including cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
      (THC), exhibit significant antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties and 
      have been shown to be an effective treatment for neuroinflammatory conditions. 
      These compounds could be promising adjuvants for PCC alone or in combination with 
      other antioxidants or therapies. PCC presents significant challenges to 
      neurological health, and neuroinflammation and oxidative stress play central 
      roles in its pathogenesis. Antioxidant therapy and cannabinoid-based approaches 
      represent promising areas of research and treatment for mitigating adverse 
      effects, but further studies are needed.

AB  - RATIONALE: Factors associated with long-term sequelae emerging after the acute 
      phase of COVID-19 (so called "long COVID") are unclear. Here, we aimed to 
      identify risk factors for the development of COVID-19 sequelae in a prospective 
      cohort of subjects hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection and followed up one year 
      after discharge. METHODS: A total of 324 subjects underwent a comprehensive and 
      multidisciplinary evaluation one year after hospital discharge for COVID-19. A 
      subgroup of 247/324 who consented to donate a blood sample were tested for a 
      panel of circulating cytokines. RESULTS: In 122 patients (37.8%) there was 
      evidence of at least one persisting physical symptom. After correcting for 
      comorbidities and COVID-19 severity, the risk of developing long COVID was lower 
      in the 109 subjects admitted to the hospital in the third wave of the pandemic 
      than in the 215 admitted during the first wave, (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.51-0.93, 
      p=0.01). Univariable analysis revealed female sex, diffusing capacity of the 
      lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) value, body mass index, anxiety and depressive 
      symptoms to be positively associated with COVID-19 sequelae at 1 year. Following 
      logistic regression analysis, DLCO was the only independent predictor of residual 
      symptoms (OR 0.98 CI 95% (0.96-0.99), p=0.01). In the subgroup of subjects with 
      normal DLCO (> 80%), for whom residual lung damage was an unlikely explanation 
      for long COVID, the presence of anxiety and depressive symptoms was significantly 
      associated to persistent symptoms, together with increased levels of a set of 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines: interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, 
      interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-1β, IL-17. In logistic regression analysis, 
      depressive symptoms (p=0.02, OR 4.57 [1.21-17.21]) and IL-12 levels (p=0.03, OR 
      1.06 [1.00-1.11]) 1-year after hospital discharge were independently associated 
      with persistence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Long COVID appears mainly related to 
      respiratory sequelae, prevalently observed during the first pandemic wave. Among 
      patients with little or no residual lung damage, a cytokine pattern consistent 
      with systemic inflammation is in place.

TI  - Long COVID-19 gastrointestinal related disorders and traditional Chinese 
      medicine: A network target-based approach.
PG  - 2323-2346

AB  - The significant number of individuals impacted by the pandemic makes prolonged 
      symptoms after COVID-19 a matter of considerable concern. These are numerous and 
      affect multiple organ systems. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 
      prolonged gastrointestinal issues are a crucial part of post-COVID-19 syndrome. 
      The resulting disruption of homeostasis underscores the need for a therapeutic 
      approach based on compounds that can simultaneously affect more than one 
      target/node. The present review aimed to check for nutraceuticals possessing 
      multiple molecular mechanisms helpful in relieving Long COVID-19-specific 
      gastrointestinal symptoms. Specific plants used in Keywords Chinese Medicine 
      (TCM) expected to be included in the WHO Global Medical Compendium were selected 
      based on the following criteria: (1) they are widely used in the Western world as 
      natural remedies and complementary medicine adjuvants; (2) their import and trade 
      are regulated by specific laws that ensure quality and safety (3) have the 
      potential to be beneficial in alleviating intestinal issues associated with Long 
      COVID-19. Searches were performed in PubMed, Elsevier, Google Scholar, Scopus, 
      Science Direct, and ResearchGate up to 2023. Cinnamomum cassia, Glycyrrhiza 
      uralensis, Magnolia officinalis, Poria cocos, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Scutellaria 
      baicalensis, and Zingiber officinalis were identified as the most promising for 
      their potential impact on inflammation and oxidative stress. Based on the 
      molecular mechanisms of the phytocomplexes and isolated compounds of the 
      considered plants, their clinical use may lead to benefits in gastrointestinal 
      diseases associated with Long COVID-19, thanks to a multiorgan and multitarget 
      approach.

AB  - Coronavirus infections are neuroinvasive and can provoke injury to the central 
      nervous system (CNS) and long-term illness consequences. They may be associated 
      with inflammatory processes due to cellular oxidative stress and an imbalanced 
      antioxidant system. The ability of phytochemicals with antioxidant and 
      anti-inflammatory activities, such as Ginkgo biloba, to alleviate neurological 
      complications and brain tissue damage has attracted strong ongoing interest in 
      the neurotherapeutic management of long COVID. Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (EGb) 
      contains several bioactive ingredients, e.g., bilobalide, quercetin, ginkgolides 
      A-C, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, and luteolin. They have various pharmacological 
      and medicinal effects, including memory and cognitive improvement. Ginkgo biloba, 
      through its anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities, 
      impacts cognitive function and other illness conditions like those in long COVID. 
      While preclinical research on the antioxidant therapies for neuroprotection has 
      shown promising results, clinical translation remains slow due to several 
      challenges (e.g., low drug bioavailability, limited half-life, instability, 
      restricted delivery to target tissues, and poor antioxidant capacity). This 
      review emphasizes the advantages of nanotherapies using nanoparticle drug 
      delivery approaches to overcome these challenges. Various experimental techniques 
      shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the oxidative stress response 
      in the nervous system and help comprehend the pathophysiology of the neurological 
      sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To develop novel therapeutic agents and drug 
      delivery systems, several methods for mimicking oxidative stress conditions have 
      been used (e.g., lipid peroxidation products, mitochondrial respiratory chain 
      inhibitors, and models of ischemic brain damage). We hypothesize the beneficial 
      effects of EGb in the neurotherapeutic management of long-term COVID-19 symptoms, 
      evaluated using either in vitro cellular or in vivo animal models of oxidative 
      stress.

TI  - Association of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir with post-acute sequelae and mortality in 
      patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have established the short-term efficacy of 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in managing COVID-19, yet its effect on post-COVID-19 
      condition, especially in patients admitted to hospital, remains understudied. 
      This study aimed to examine the effect of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir on post-COVID-19 
      condition among patients admitted to hospital in Hong Kong. METHODS: This 
      retrospective cohort study used real-world, territory-wide inpatient records, 
      vaccination records, and confirmed COVID-19 case data from the Hong Kong Hospital 
      Authority and Department of Health, The Government of the Hong Kong Special 
      Administrative Region. Patients aged 18 years and older who tested positive for 
      SARS-CoV-2 between March 11, 2022, and Oct 10, 2023, and who were admitted to 
      hospital with COVID-19 were included. The treatment group included patients 
      prescribed nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days of symptom onset, excluding those 
      prescribed molnupiravir within 21 days, and the control group had no exposure to 
      either nirmatrelvir-ritonavir or molnupiravir. The outcomes were post-acute 
      inpatient death and 13 sequelae (congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, 
      coronary artery disease, deep vein thrombosis, chronic pulmonary disease, acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial lung disease, seizure, anxiety, 
      post-traumatic stress disorder, end-stage renal disease, acute kidney injury, and 
      pancreatitis). These outcomes were evaluated starting at 21 days after the 
      positive RT-PCR date in each respective cohort constructed for the outcome. 
      Standardised mortality ratio weights were applied to balance covariates, and Cox 
      proportional hazards regression was used to investigate the relationship between 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and outcomes. FINDINGS: 136 973 patients were screened for 
      inclusion, among whom 50 055 were eligible and included in the analysis (24 873 
      [49·7%] were female and 25 182 [50·3%] were male). 15 242 patients were 
      prescribed nirmatrelvir-ritonavir during acute COVID-19 and 23 756 patients were 
      included in the control group; 11 057 patients did not meet our definition for 
      the exposed and unexposed groups. Patients were followed up for a median of 393 
      days (IQR 317-489). In the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group compared with the control 
      group, there was a significantly lower hazard of post-acute inpatient death 
      (hazard ratio 0·62 [95% CI 0·57-0·68]; p<0·0001), congestive heart failure (0·70 
      [0·58-0·85]; p=0·0002), atrial fibrillation (0·63 [0·52-0·76]; p<0·0001), 
      coronary artery disease (0·71 [0·59-0·85]; p=0·0002), chronic pulmonary disease 
      (0·68 [0·54-0·86]; p=0·0011), acute respiratory distress syndrome (0·71 
      [0·58-0·86]; p=0·0007), interstitial lung disease (0·17 [0·04-0·75]; p=0·020), 
      and end-stage renal disease (0·37 [0·18-0·74]; p=0·0049). There was no evidence 
      indicating difference between the groups in deep vein thrombosis, seizure, 
      anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, acute kidney injury, and pancreatitis. 
      INTERPRETATION: This study showed extended benefits of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for 
      reducing the risk of post-acute inpatient death as well as cardiovascular and 
      respiratory complications among patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. 
      Further research is essential to uncover the underlying mechanisms responsible 
      for these observed negative associations and to devise effective strategies for 
      preventing the onset of post-acute sequelae. FUNDING: Health and Medical Research

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although pulmonary fibrosis secondary to COVID-19 infection is 
      uncommon, it can lead to problems if not treated effectively in the early period. 
      This study aimed to compare the effects of treatment with nintedanib and 
      pirfenidone in patients with COVID-19-related fibrosis. METHODS: Thirty patients 
      who presented to the post-COVID outpatient clinic between May 2021 and April 2022 
      with a history of COVID-19 pneumonia and exhibited persistent cough, dyspnea, 
      exertional dyspnea, and low oxygen saturation at least 12 weeks after diagnosis 
      were included. The patients were randomized to receive off-label treatment with 
      nintedanib or pirfenidone and were followed up for 12 weeks. RESULTS: After 12 
      weeks of treatment, all pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters, 6MWT distance, 
      and oxygen saturation were increased compared to baseline in both the pirfenidone 
      group and nintedanib groups, while heart rate and radiological score levels were 
      decreased (p<0.05 for all). The changes in 6MWT distance and oxygen saturation 
      were significantly greater in the nintedanib group than in the pirfenidone group 
      (p=0.02 and 0.005, respectively). Adverse drug effects were more frequent with 
      nintedanib than pirfenidone, with the most common being diarrhea, nausea, and 
      vomiting. CONCLUSION: In patients with interstitial fibrosis after COVID-19 
      pneumonia, both nintedanib and pirfenidone were observed to be effective in 
      improving radiological score and PFT parameters. Nintedanib was more effective 
      than pirfenidone in increasing exercise capacity and saturation values but caused 
      more adverse drug effects.

TI  - Connecting the Dots in Emerging Mast Cell Research: Do Factors Affecting Mast

      Social Determinants of Health?
LID - 10.3390/medsci10020029 [doi]
LID - 29
AB  - Evidence continues to emerge that the social determinants of health play a role 
      in adverse outcomes related to COVID-19, including increased morbidity and 
      mortality, increased risk of long COVID, and vaccine adverse effects. Therefore, 
      a more nuanced understanding of the biochemical and cellular pathways of 
      illnesses commonly associated with adverse social determinants of health is 
      urgently needed. We contend that a commitment to understanding adverse outcomes 
      in historically marginalized communities will increase community-level confidence 
      in public health measures. Here, we synthesize emerging literature on mast cell 
      disease, and the role of mast cells in chronic illness, alongside emerging 
      research on mechanisms of COVID illness and vaccines. We propose that a focus on 
      aberrant and/or hyperactive mast cell behavior associated with chronic underlying 
      health conditions can elucidate adverse COVID-related outcomes and contribute to 
      the pandemic recovery. Standards of care for mast cell activation syndrome 
      (MCAS), as well as clinical reviews, experimental research, and case reports, 
      suggest that effective and cost-efficient remedies are available, including 
      antihistamines, vitamin C, and quercetin, among others. Primary care physicians, 
      specialists, and public health workers should consider new and emerging evidence 
      from the biomedical literature in tackling COVID-19. Specialists and researchers 
      note that MCAS is likely grossly under-diagnosed; therefore, public health 
      agencies and policy makers should urgently attend to community-based experiences 
      of adverse COVID outcomes. It is essential that we extract and examine 
      experiential evidence of marginalized communities from the broader 
      political-ideological discourse.

TI  - Viral hepatitis in persons living with HIV in the post-COVID era.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.24875/AIDSRev.M23000061 [doi]
AB  - Coinfection with hepatitis viruses A to E is frequent in persons living with HIV 
      (PLWH) and causes significant morbidity and mortality. Oro-fecal transmissible 
      hepatitis A and E mostly produce acute self-limited episodes in poor income 
      regions and in non-vaccinated travelers. In high-income countries, outbreaks of 
      hepatitis A occur in men having sex with men (MSM) and chronic hepatitis E is 
      occasionally reported among PLWH with severe immunodeficiency. Chronic hepatitis 
      B, C, and D are frequent in PLWH in highly endemic regions and globally in 
      persons who inject drugs (PWID) and MSM. Progression to liver cirrhosis and 
      development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is major clinical complications in 
      coinfected patients. Current estimates for PLWH are of 38 million worldwide. 
      Roughly 12% have chronic viral hepatitis (5 million). Coinfection figures are of 
      5-10% for HBV (2-4 million), 4% for HCV (1.5 million), and 15% of HBsAg+ for HDV 
      (0.5 million). Oral direct-acting antivirals (DAA) cure almost all treated 
      patients with hepatitis C. However, given that there is no protective HCV 
      immunity, PLWH with high-risk behaviors may experience HCV reinfection episodes. 
      Tenofovir is the drug of choice in PLWH with chronic hepatitis B, given its dual 
      effect on HIV and HBV. Lifelong oral tenofovir suppresses HBV replication and 
      ameliorate liver damage. However, the risk of HCC persists even in the absence of 
      cirrhosis. Finally, HDV causes the worst of viral hepatitis with faster 
      progression to cirrhosis and HCC. An entry inhibitor, bulevirtide, has recently 
      been approved and another drug, lonafarnib, is completing Phase 3 trials. 
      Combination antiviral therapy for hepatitis D could improve dramatically the poor 
      prognosis of HIV-HDV coinfected patients. The resumption of good medical 
      practices in PLWH after the big disruption caused by COVID-19 will reduce the 
      burden of viral hepatitis coinfections. Renewed efforts on HAV and HBV 
      vaccination of susceptible individuals and earlier and wider prescription of 
      antiviral therapy for HBV, HCV, and/or HDV coinfection should be prioritized in 
      PLWH. The benefits of innovative strategies for viral hepatitis, including 
      pre-exposure prophylaxis or use of long-acting antivirals, warrant further 
      consideration in PLWH.

TI  - Feasibility of Vitamin C in the Treatment of Post Viral Fatigue with Focus on 
      Long COVID, Based on a Systematic Review of IV Vitamin C on Fatigue.
LID - 10.3390/nu13041154 [doi]
LID - 1154
AB  - Fatigue is common not only in cancer patients but also after viral and other 
      infections. Effective treatment options are still very rare. Therefore, the 
      present knowledge on the pathophysiology of fatigue and the potential positive 
      impact of treatment with vitamin C is illustrated. Additionally, the 
      effectiveness of high-dose IV vitamin C in fatigue resulting from various 
      diseases was assessed by a systematic literature review in order to assess the 
      feasibility of vitamin C in post-viral, especially in long COVID, fatigue. Nine 
      clinical studies with 720 participants were identified. Three of the four 
      controlled trials observed a significant decrease in fatigue scores in the 
      vitamin C group compared to the control group. Four of the five observational or 
      before-and-after studies observed a significant reduction in pre-post levels of 
      fatigue. Attendant symptoms of fatigue such as sleep disturbances, lack of 
      concentration, depression, and pain were also frequently alleviated. Oxidative 
      stress, inflammation, and circulatory disorders, which are important contributors 
      to fatigue, are also discussed in long COVID fatigue. Thus, the antioxidant, 
      anti-inflammatory, endothelial-restoring, and immunomodulatory effects of 
      high-dose IV vitamin C might be a suitable treatment option.

AB  - Objective: To summarize the application experience and the therapeutic effect of 
      Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir (trade name: Paxlovid) for COVID-19 in children. Methods: 
      A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data, including collecting 
      the clinical manifestations and clinical outcomes, dynamically monitoring the 
      blood routine, hepatic and renal function and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid results, 
      and observing the related side effects during the treatment, etc, of 3 cases with 
      COVID-19 treated with Paxlovid admitted to Shanghai Children's Hospital 
      (designated referral hospital for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shanghai) from May 
      1(st) to June 1(st), 2022. Results: The 3 cases were 12, 14, 17 years of age, 
      among which 2 cases were males, 1 case was female. All 3 cases were mild cases 
      with underlying diseases and risk of developing into severe COVID-19, with 
      symptoms of high fever, sore throat and dry cough. The treatment of Paxlovid at 
      3(rd) day of symptom onset contributed to the symptom-free after 1-2 days and 
      negative results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid after 2-4 days. All patients had no 
      adverse manifestations of gastrointestinal tract and nervous system but a case 
      had little skin rashes, which recovered after the withdrawal of Paxlovid. Three 
      cases had normal hepatic and renal function during the Paxlovid treatment. At 3 
      months after discharge, no clinical manifestations of post-COVID syndrome were 
      found in all 3 cases. Conclusion: Paxlovid was effective and relatively safe in 
      the treatment of 3 children with COVID-19.

      Role of N-acetylcysteine and Acetyl-L-carnitine.
PG  - 686-704
LID - 10.2174/011570159X343115241030094848 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as anosmia, anxiety, 
      depression, stress-related reactions, and psychoses. The illness can cause 
      persistent cognitive impairment and "brain fog", suggesting chronic brain 
      involvement. Clinical entities of ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 and Post COVID 
      Syndrome (PCS) mainly present neuropsychiatric symptoms such as dysgeusia, 
      headache, fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic 
      stress disorder. The pathophysiology of COVID-19-related brain damage is unclear, 
      but it is linked to various mechanisms such as inflammation, oxidative stress, 
      immune dysregulation, impaired glutamate homeostasis, glial and glymphatic 
      damage, and hippocampal degeneration. Noteworthy is that the metabotropic 
      receptor mGluR2 was discovered as a mechanism of internalisation of SARS-CoV-2 in 
      Central Nervous System (CNS) cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and acetyl-L-carnitine 
      (ALC) are two supplements that have already been found effective in treating 
      psychiatric conditions. Furthermore, NAC showed evidence in relieving cognitive 
      symptomatology in PCS, and ALC was found effective in treating depressive 
      symptomatology of PCS. The overlapping effects on the glutamatergic system of ALC 
      and NAC could help treat COVID-19 psychiatric symptoms and PCS, acting through 
      different mechanisms on the xc-mGluR2 network, with potentially synergistic 
      effects on chronic pain and neuro-astrocyte protection. This paper aims to 
      summarise the current evidence on the potential therapeutic role of NAC and ALC, 
      providing an overview of the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathophysiology. 
      It proposes a pathophysiological model explaining the effectiveness of NAC and 
      ALC in treating COVID-19-related neuropsychiatric symptoms.

AB  - The patient suffered from a mild form of COVID-19 and was treated on an 
      outpatient basis. According to the family doctor's prescription, she took 
      Azithromycin 500 mg a day per os for 6 days, and then Ceftriaxone 1.0 g twice a 
      day i.m. for another 6 days. Diarrhea appeared on the 10th day of treatment up to 
      10-15 times a day, a month later - blood admixtures in the stool appeared. The 
      result was negative. Data from colonoscopy and histological examination of the 
      intestinal mucosa and the clinical picture showed nonspecific ulcerative colitis, 
      moderately severe. The patient started treatment with Salofalk first at a dose of 
      2 mg and then 4 mg per day. Due to the insufficient clinical effect, the patient 
      was additionally prescribed Budenofalk in a daily dose of 9 mg with a positive 
      clinical effect.

TI  - Antioxidant Genetic Variants Modify Echocardiography Indices in Long COVID.
LID - 10.3390/ijms241210234 [doi]

AB  - Although disturbance of redox homeostasis might be responsible for COVID-19 
      cardiac complications, this molecular mechanism has not been addressed yet. We 
      have proposed modifying the effects of antioxidant proteins polymorphisms 
      (superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), glutathione 
      peroxidase 3 (GPX3) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, (Nrf2)) in 
      individual susceptibility towards the development of cardiac manifestations of 
      long COVID-19. The presence of subclinical cardiac dysfunction was assessed via 
      echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in 174 convalescent 
      COVID-19 patients. SOD2, GPX1, GPX3 and Nrf2 polymorphisms were determined via 
      the appropriate PCR methods. No significant association of the investigated 
      polymorphisms with the risk of arrhythmia development was found. However, the 
      carriers of variant GPX1*T, GPX3*C or Nrf2*A alleles were more than twice less 
      prone for dyspnea development in comparison with the carriers of the referent 
      ones. These findings were even more potentiated in the carriers of any two 
      variant alleles of these genes (OR = 0.273, and p = 0.016). The variant GPX 
      alleles were significantly associated with left atrial and right ventricular 
      echocardiographic parameters, specifically LAVI, RFAC and RV-EF (p = 0.025, p = 
      0.009, and p = 0.007, respectively). Based on the relation between the variant 
      SOD2*T allele and higher levels of LV echocardiographic parameters, EDD, LVMI and 
      GLS, as well as troponin T (p = 0.038), it can be proposed that recovered 
      COVID-19 patients, who are the carriers of this genetic variant, might have 
      subtle left ventricular systolic dysfunction. No significant association between 
      the investigated polymorphisms and cardiac disfunction was observed when cardiac 
      magnetic resonance imaging was performed. Our results on the association between 
      antioxidant genetic variants and long COVID cardiological manifestations 
      highlight the involvement of genetic propensity in both acute and long COVID 
      clinical manifestations.

AB  - The nature of the inflammatory and fibrotic processes found in patients with 
      post-COVID-19 syndrome makes it possible to speculate that in such patients 
      fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) may be a useful biomarker. Consequently, 
      we set out to verify the consistency of this hypothesis. We consecutively 
      enrolled 68 post-COVID patients after being hospitalized for persistent clinical 
      manifestations within 2 months from disease onset and 29 healthy volunteers as 
      control group. None of post-COVID patients had bronchial asthma or were being 
      treated with a corticosteroid. Only 19 out of 68 post-COVID-19 patients reported 
      a FeNO value > 25 ppb. The mean FeNO value in post-COVID-19 patients was 
      18.55 ppb (95% CI: 15.50 to 21.58), while in healthy subjects it was 17.46 ppb 
      (95% CI: 15.75 to 19.17). The mean difference was not statistically significant 
      (P = 0.053). However, the mean FeNO value of post-COVID-19 patients was higher in 
      men than in women (20.97 ppb; 95% CI: 16.61 to 25.33 vs 14.36 ppb; 95% CI: 11.11 
      to 17.61) with a difference between the two sexes that was statistically 
      significant (P = 0.016). Mean FeNO was 14.89 ppb (95% CI: 10.90 to 18.89) in 
      patients who had been treated with systemic corticosteroids because of their 
      COVID-19, and 20.80 ppb (95% CI: 16.56 to 25.04) in those who had not taken them, 
      with a difference that was statistically significant (P = 0.043). The data 
      generated in this study suggest that measurement of FeNO is not useful as a 
      biomarker in post-COVID-19 patient. However, this hypothesis needs solid 
      validation with additional specifically designed studies.

AB  - Damage in COVID-19 results from both the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its triggered 
      overactive host immune responses. Therapeutic agents that focus solely on 
      reducing viral load or hyperinflammation fail to provide satisfying outcomes in 
      all cases. Although viral and cellular factors have been extensively profiled to 
      identify potential anti-COVID-19 targets, new drugs with significant efficacy 
      remain to be developed. Here, we report the potent preclinical efficacy of 
      ALD-R491, a vimentin-targeting small molecule compound, in treating COVID-19 
      through its host-directed antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions. We found that 
      by altering the physical properties of vimentin filaments, ALD-491 affected 
      general cellular processes as well as specific cellular functions relevant to 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, ALD-R491 reduced endocytosis, endosomal 
      trafficking, and exosomal release, thus impeding the entry and egress of the 
      virus; increased the microcidal capacity of macrophages, thus facilitating the 
      pathogen clearance; and enhanced the activity of regulatory T cells, therefore 
      suppressing the overactive immune responses. In cultured cells, ALD-R491 potently 
      inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2-mediated pseudoviral 
      infection. In aged mice with ongoing, productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, ALD-R491 
      reduced disease symptoms as well as lung damage. In rats, ALD-R491 also reduced 
      bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis. Our results indicate a unique 
      mechanism and significant therapeutic potential for ALD-R491 against COVID-19. We 
      anticipate that ALD-R491, an oral, fast-acting, and non-cytotoxic agent targeting 
      the cellular protein with multipart actions, will be convenient, safe, and 
      broadly effective, regardless of viral mutations, for patients with early- or 
      late-stage disease, post-COVID-19 complications, and other related diseases. 
      IMPORTANCE With the Delta variant currently fueling a resurgence of new 
      infections in the fully vaccinated population, developing an effective 
      therapeutic drug is especially critical and urgent in fighting COVID-19. In 
      contrast to the many efforts to repurpose existing drugs or address only one 
      aspect of COVID-19, we are developing a novel agent with first-in-class 
      mechanisms of action that address both the viral infection and the overactive 
      immune system in the pathogenesis of the disease. Unlike virus-directed 
      therapeutics that may lose efficacy due to viral mutations, and 
      immunosuppressants that require ideal timing to be effective, this agent, with 
      its unique host-directed antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions, can work 
      against all variants of the virus, be effective during all stages of the disease, 
      and even resolve post-disease damage and complications. Further development of 
      the compound will provide an important tool in the fight against COVID-19 and its 
      complications, as well as future outbreaks of new viruses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated the efficacy and safety of providing 
      medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and individualized telehealth in 
      Kentucky, a state severely impacted simultaneously by the opioid epidemic and the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The investigation analyzed pre- and post-COVID-19 
      characteristics in 191 opioid use disorder (OUD) buprenorphine outpatients who 
      completed an 18-question survey in late 2020 related to COVID testing, OUD 
      relapses, obstacles to maintaining abstinence, and treatment resources. RESULTS: 
      The study revealed no statistically significant changes in drug use before and 
      after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic despite monthly volume increases. 
      Results further demonstrated statistically significant barriers to treatment, 
      including loss of housing and transportation, food insecurity, and onset of 
      depression. No patients required hospitalization or succumbed to OUD or COVID-19. 
      Potentially effective resource utilization findings included clinic 
      transportation and 24/7 crisis intervention. Respondents rated telehealth as 
      helpful when used in an individualized hybrid model matching patient's need to 
      available resources based on COVID-19 safety guidelines. CONCLUSION: This report 
      yields key clinical insights into providing outpatient MOUD care during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic, validating in-person care as both safe and effective. 
      Patients' experiences proved helpful in identifying and quantifying obstacles to 
      abstinence in conjunction with facilitating continued patient access to essential 
      clinical resources. Notably, telehealth can supplement rather than replace 
      in-person treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (Paxlovid) have been used in the 
      treatment of adult patients with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Paxlovid on in-hospital 
      outcomes and post-COVID-19 condition in Chinese adult patients infected with 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant. 
      METHODS: This non-randomized clinical controlled trial recruited patients 
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant from the designated hospital for 
      treating COVID-19 between November 5 and November 28, 2022, in Shijiazhuang, 
      China. Participants were administered Paxlovid (300 mg of nirmatrelvir and 100 mg 
      of ritonavir orally) or standard treatment. The primary outcome was the nucleic 
      acid shedding time and post-COVID-19 condition. RESULTS: A total of 320 patients 
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant were included, with mean age of 
      29.10 ± 7.34 years old. Two hundred patients received Paxlovid. Compared to 
      patients in the standard treatment group, those in Paxlovid group had a 
      significantly shorter nucleic acid shedding time (3.26 ± 1.80 vs 7.75 ± 3.68 
      days, P < .001), shorter days until negative swab test (1.74 ± 1.15 vs 
      5.33 ± 2.91, P < .001), shorter days of first symptoms resolution (4.86 ± 1.62 vs 
      7.45 ± 2.63, P < .001), higher in nucleic acid test negative rate within 3 days 
      [138 (70.77%) vs 14 (11.67%), P < .001], higher negative rate within 5 days [174 
      (89.23%) vs 26 (21.67%), P < .001], negative rate within 7 days [185 (94.87%) vs 
      78 (65.00%), P < .001], and were less likely to have post-COVID-19 condition [32 
      (18.60%) vs 30 (31.57%), P = .016]. There was no significant difference in 
      duration of post-COVID-19 condition (43.00 ± 26.00 vs 49.00 ± 26.34 days, 
      P = .354) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Compared to standard treatment, 
      Paxlovid significantly reduced nucleic acid shedding time, days until negative 
      swab test, and days of first symptoms resolution, as well as improved nucleic 
      acid test negative rate and post-COVID-19 condition.

TI  - Nanomedicine-mediated recovery of antioxidant glutathione peroxidase activity 
      after oxidative-stress cellular damage: Insights for neurological long COVID.
PG  - e29680
LID - 10.1002/jmv.29680 [doi]
AB  - Nanomedicine for treating post-viral infectious disease syndrome is at an 
      emerging stage. Despite promising results from preclinical studies on 
      conventional antioxidants, their clinical translation as a therapy for treating 
      post-COVID conditions remains challenging. The limitations are due to their low 
      bioavailability, instability, limited transport to the target tissues, and short 
      half-life, requiring frequent and high doses. Activating the immune system during 
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to increased production of reactive 
      oxygen species (ROS), depleted antioxidant reserve, and finally, oxidative stress 
      and neuroinflammation. To tackle this problem, we developed an antioxidant 
      nanotherapy based on lipid (vesicular and cubosomal types) nanoparticles (LNPs) 
      co-encapsulating ginkgolide B and quercetin. The antioxidant-loaded nanocarriers 
      were prepared by a self-assembly method via hydration of a lyophilized mixed thin 
      lipid film. We evaluated the LNPs in a new in vitro model for studying neuronal 
      dysfunction caused by oxidative stress in coronavirus infection. We examined the 
      key downstream signaling pathways that are triggered in response to potassium 
      persulfate (KPS) causing oxidative stress-mediated neurotoxicity. Treatment of 
      neuronally-derived cells (SH-SY5Y) with KPS (50 mM) for 30 min markedly increased 
      mitochondrial dysfunction while depleting the levels of both glutathione 
      peroxidase (GSH-Px) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). This led to the sequential 
      activation of apoptotic and necrotic cell death processes, which corroborates 
      with the crucial implication of the two proteins (GSH-Px and TH) in the 
      long-COVID syndrome. Nanomedicine-mediated treatment with ginkgolide B-loaded 
      cubosomes and vesicular LNPs showed minimal cytotoxicity and completely 
      attenuated the KPS-induced cell death process, decreasing apoptosis from 32.6% 
      (KPS) to 19.0% (MO-GB), 12.8% (MO-GB-Quer), 14.8% (DMPC-PEG-GB), and 23.6% 
      (DMPC-PEG-GB-Quer) via free radical scavenging and replenished GSH-Px levels. 
      These findings indicated that GB-LNPs-based nanomedicines may protect against 
      KPS-induced apoptosis by regulating intracellular redox homeostasis.

TI  - Efficacy of Gabapentin For Post-COVID-19 Olfactory Dysfunction: The GRACE 
      Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 1111-1119
LID - 10.1001/jamaoto.2023.2958 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic affected millions of people and has become a 
      dominant etiology of olfactory dysfunction (OD). No interventions with definitive 
      clinical utility exist. Gabapentin represents a potential therapy for 
      COVID-19-induced OD. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of oral gabapentin on 
      olfactory function and olfaction-related quality of life in patients with 
      COVID-19-induced OD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pilot 
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) was conducted 
      at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis from January 7, 2022, to 
      February 3, 2023. Adults with at least 3 months of OD after COVID-19 infection 
      were eligible for inclusion. Participants with a history of other causes of OD or 
      contraindications to gabapentin were excluded. INTERVENTION: Patients were 
      randomized 1:1 to oral gabapentin or placebo. All patients underwent titration to 
      a maximum tolerable dose, which was maintained during an 8-week fixed-dose (FD) 
      phase then tapered off. Participants were monitored for 4 weeks following 
      cessation of study medication. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes were assessed 
      following the 8-week FD phase and 4 weeks after taper completion. The primary 
      outcome measure was the response rate determined by subjective improvement in OD 
      on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) after the FD phase. 
      Other subjective and objective measures of olfactory function were also assessed 
      as secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: Sixty-eight participants were enrolled 
      (34 randomized to each arm), a total of 44 participants completed the FD period 
      and 20 (45.4%) reported response to treatment with at least slight improvement in 
      olfaction from baseline. Of those randomized, 51 (75%) were women and 56 were 
      White (82%) with a mean (SD) age of 43 (13.5) years. Baseline demographic 
      features including age, sex, and race and ethnicity were not significantly 
      different between the groups. Of the 18 participants in the gabapentin group, 8 
      (44%) were responders and of the 26 participants in the placebo group, 12 (46%) 
      reported response to treatment (percent difference, 1.7%; 95% CI, -31.6% to 
      28.2%). Mixed-model analysis of all secondary outcome measures demonstrated no 
      clinically meaningful or statistically significant difference between the 
      gabapentin and placebo groups throughout the trial. There were no serious adverse 
      events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, gabapentin 
      was not associated with statistically significant or clinically meaningful 
      benefit over placebo and likely is not an efficacious therapy for 
      COVID-19-induced OD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

TI  - Colchicine prophylaxis is associated with fewer gout flares after COVID-19 
      vaccination.
PG  - 1189-1193

AB  - OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 vaccination often triggers a constellation of transitory 
      inflammatory symptoms. Gout is associated with several comorbidities linked to 
      poor outcomes in COVID-19, and gout flares can be triggered by some vaccinations. 
      We analysed the risk of gout flares in the first 3 months after COVID-19 
      vaccination with inactivated virus, and whether colchicine can prevent gout 
      flares following post-COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: A clinical delivery 
      population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the Gout Clinic at the 
      Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University between February and October 2021. 
      Study participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique 
      among follow-up patients with gout. We collected data, including vaccinations and 
      potential risk factors, using a combination of interviews, health QR codes and 
      medical records. Logistic regression was used to adjust for covariates. RESULTS: 
      We enrolled 549 gout participants (median age 39 years, 84.2% vaccinated). For 
      the 462 patients who received COVID-19 vaccine, 203 (43.9%) developed at least 
      one gout flare in the 3 months after vaccination. Most of these flares were 
      experienced within 1 month after the first (99/119 (83.2%)) or second (70/115 
      (60.9%)) dose of vaccine. Compared with unvaccinated participants, COVID-19 
      vaccination was associated with higher odds of gout flare within 3 months 
      (adjusted OR 6.02; 95% CI 3.00 to 12.08). Colchicine use was associated with 47% 
      less likelihood of postvaccine gout flare. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccination was 
      associated with increased odds of gout flare, which developed mainly in month 1 
      after each vaccine dose, and was negatively associated with colchicine 
      prophylaxis.

      and Cognitive Disorders.

AB  - Mental disorders account for one of the most prevalent categories of the burden 
      of disease worldwide, with depression expected to be the largest contributor by 
      2030, closely followed by anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic possibly exacerbated 
      these challenges, especially amongst adolescents, who experienced isolation, 
      disrupted routines, and limited healthcare access. Notably, the pandemic has been 
      associated with long-term neurological effects known as "long-COVID", 
      characterized by both cognitive and psychopathological symptoms. In general, 
      psychiatric disorders, including those related to long-COVID, are supposed to be 
      due to widespread inflammation leading to neuroinflammation. Recently, the 
      endocannabinoid system (ECS) emerged as a potential target for addressing 
      depression and anxiety pathophysiology. Specifically, natural or synthetic 
      cannabinoids, able to selectively interact with cannabinoid type-2 receptor 
      (CB2R), recently revealed new therapeutic potential in neuropsychiatric disorders 
      with limited or absent psychotropic activity. Among the most promising natural 
      CB2R ligands, the bicyclic sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene (BCP) has emerged as an 
      excellent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant therapeutic agent. This review 
      underscores BCP's immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, highlighting 
      its therapeutic potential for the management of depression and anxiety.

TI  - Application of Kampo Medicines for Treatment of General Fatigue Due to Long 
      COVID.
LID - 10.3390/medicina58060730 [doi]
LID - 730
AB  - Evidence regarding treatment for the acute phase of COVID-19 has been 
      accumulating, but specific treatment for long COVID/post-COVID-19 condition has 
      not yet been established. Treatment with herbal medicine might be one treatment 
      option for long COVID, but there has been little research on the effectiveness of 
      herbal medicine for long COVID. The aim of this study was to clarify the 
      prescription patterns of Kampo medicines, which are herbal medicines that 
      originated in China and were developed in Japan, for the treatment of general 
      fatigue due to long COVID. A retrospective descriptive study was performed for 
      patients who visited a COVID-19 aftercare clinic established in Okayama 
      University Hospital during the period from Feb 2021 to Dec 2021 with a focus on 
      symptoms accompanying general fatigue and prescriptions of Kampo medicine. Among 
      the clinical data obtained from medical records of 195 patients, clinical data 
      for 102 patients with general fatigue and accompanying symptoms were analyzed. 
      The patients had various symptoms, and the most frequent symptoms accompanying 
      general fatigue were dysosmia, dysgeusia, headache, insomnia, dyspnea, and hair 
      loss. Prescriptions of Kampo medicine accounted for 24.1% of the total 
      prescriptions (n = 609). The most frequently prescribed Kampo medicine was 
      hochuekkito (71.6%) and other prescribed Kampo medicines were tokishakuyakusan, 
      ryokeijutsukanto, juzentaihoto, hangekobokuto, kakkonto, ninjin'yoeito, goreisan, 
      rikkunshito, and keishibukuryogan. Since the pathophysiology of general fatigue 
      after an infectious disease is, in general, considered a qi deficiency in Kampo 
      medicine, treatments with such compensation agents can be the major prescription 
      as a complement for the qi. In conclusion, Kampo medicine can be one of the main 
      pharmacological treatments for long COVID accompanying general fatigue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Metformin has antiviral activity against RNA viruses including severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The mechanism appears to 
      be suppression of protein translation via targeting the host mechanistic target 
      of rapamycin pathway. In the COVID-OUT randomized trial for outpatient 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), metformin reduced the odds of 
      hospitalizations/death through 28 days by 58%, of emergency department 
      visits/hospitalizations/death through 14 days by 42%, and of long COVID through 
      10 months by 42%. METHODS: COVID-OUT was a 2 × 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, 
      double-blind trial that assessed metformin, fluvoxamine, and ivermectin; 999 
      participants self-collected anterior nasal swabs on day 1 (n = 945), day 5 (n = 
      871), and day 10 (n = 775). Viral load was quantified using reverse-transcription 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The mean SARS-CoV-2 viral load 
      was reduced 3.6-fold with metformin relative to placebo (-0.56 log10 copies/mL; 
      95% confidence interval [CI], -1.05 to -.06; P = .027). Those who received 
      metformin were less likely to have a detectable viral load than placebo at day 5 
      or day 10 (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; 95% CI, .55 to .94). Viral rebound, defined as 
      a higher viral load at day 10 than day 5, was less frequent with metformin 
      (3.28%) than placebo (5.95%; OR, 0.68; 95% CI, .36 to 1.29). The metformin effect 
      was consistent across subgroups and increased over time. Neither ivermectin nor 
      fluvoxamine showed effect over placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized, 
      placebo-controlled trial of outpatient treatment of SARS-CoV-2, metformin 
      significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load, which may explain the clinical 
      benefits in this trial. Metformin is pleiotropic with other actions that are 
      relevant to COVID-19 pathophysiology. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT04510194.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection play a crucial role in the 
      pathophysiology of COVID-19 and hyperinflammatory responses have been associated 
      with poor clinical outcomes, with progression to severe conditions or long-term 
      subacute complications named as long-COVID-19. METHODS: In this cross-sectional 
      study, we aimed to evaluate a set of antigen-specific inflammatory cytokines in 
      blood from recovered COVID-19 individuals or who suffered a post-acute phase of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to healthy individuals with no history of COVID-19 
      exposition or infection. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), IFN-γ-induced protein 10 
      (IP-10), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, 
      IL-12, and IL-17A were quantified by multiplex cytometric bead assay and 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after stimulation of whole blood with 
      recombinant Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, all participants have 
      evaluated for anti-(S) protein-specific IgG antibodies. Clinical specimens were 
      collected within two months of COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 47 
      individuals were enrolled in the study, a median age of 43 years (IQR = 14.5), 
      grouped into healthy individuals with no history of infection or exposure to 
      SARS-CoV-2 (unexposed group; N = 21); and patients from the Health Complex of the 
      Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ), Brazil, who were SARS-CoV-2 positive by 
      RT-PCR (COVID-19 group)-categorized as recovered COVID-19 (N = 11) or 
      long-COVID-19 (N = 15). All COVID-19 patients presented at least one signal or 
      symptom during the first two weeks of infection. Six patients were hospitalized 
      and required invasive mechanical ventilation. Our results showed that COVID-19 
      patients had significantly higher levels of IFN-γ, TNF, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, 
      and IP-10 than the unexposed group. The long-COVID-19 group has presented 
      significantly high levels of IL-1β and IL-6 compared to unexposed individuals, 
      but not from recovered COVID-19. A principal-component analysis demonstrated 
      84.3% of the total variance of inflammatory-SARS-CoV-2 response in the first two 
      components, and it was possible to stratify IL-6, TNF, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-2 as 
      the top-five cytokines which are candidates to discriminate COVID-19 group 
      (including long-COVID-19 subgroup) and healthy unexposed individuals. CONCLUSION: 
      We revealed important S protein-specific differential biomarkers in individuals 
      affected by COVID-19, bringing new insights into the inflammatory status or 
      SARS-CoV-2 exposition determination.

TI  - Long-COVID post-viral chronic fatigue and affective symptoms are associated with 
      oxidative damage, lowered antioxidant defenses and inflammation: a proof of

AB  - The immune-inflammatory response during the acute phase of COVID-19, as assessed 
      using peak body temperature (PBT) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), 
      predicts the severity of chronic fatigue, depression and anxiety symptoms 3-4 
      months later. The present study was performed to examine the effects of SpO2 and 
      PBT during acute infection on immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) 
      pathways and neuropsychiatric symptoms of Long COVID. This study assayed SpO2 and 
      PBT during acute COVID-19, and C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), 
      protein carbonyls (PCs), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO), zinc, and 
      glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) in 120 Long COVID individuals and 36 controls. 
      Cluster analysis showed that 31.7% of the Long COVID patients had severe 
      abnormalities in SpO2, body temperature, increased oxidative toxicity (OSTOX) and 
      lowered antioxidant defenses (ANTIOX), and increased total Hamilton Depression 
      (HAMD) and Anxiety (HAMA) and Fibromylagia-Fatigue (FF) scores. Around 60% of the 
      variance in the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Long COVID (a factor extracted from 
      HAMD, HAMA and FF scores) was explained by OSTOX/ANTIOX ratio, PBT and SpO2. 
      Increased PBT predicted increased CRP and lowered ANTIOX and zinc levels, while 
      lowered SpO2 predicted lowered Gpx and increased NO production. Lowered SpO2 
      strongly predicts OSTOX/ANTIOX during Long COVID. In conclusion, the impact of 
      acute COVID-19 on the symptoms of Long COVID is partly mediated by OSTOX/ANTIOX, 
      especially lowered Gpx and zinc, increased MPO and NO production and lipid 
      peroxidation-associated aldehyde formation. The results suggest that post-viral 
      somatic and mental symptoms have a neuroimmune and neuro-oxidative origin.

TI  - The possible role of ursolic acid in Covid-19: A real game changer.

AB  - Ursolic acid (UA) is a pentacyclic terpenoid is usually found in the fruit peels 
      and stem bark as secondary metabolites. UA has antiviral, antibacterial, and 
      antiparasitic properties. UA has a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities 
      against different infections. Because of the greatest antiviral and 
      anti-inflammatory properties of UA, so it could be a plausible therapeutic herbal 
      medicine in Covid-19 treatment. Covid-19 is a recent worldwide virulent disease 
      pandemic due to severe acute respiratory coronavirus disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The 
      pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is related to the direct cytopathic effect 
      and exaggerated immune response by which acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome might be developed in critical cases. UA may 
      inhibit main protease of SARS-CoV-2, and inhibits the interface flanked by 
      SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and its entry point commonly recognized as angiotensin 
      converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In addition, UA attenuates SARS-CoV-2-induced 
      inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress. Therefore, UA could avert SARS-CoV-2 
      infection from causing ALI. This opinion proposed that UA might be a potential 
      candidate therapy against Covid-19 and can mitigate post-Covid-19 complications 
      such as lung fibrosis. In this regards, forthcoming studies are reasonable to 
      substantiate the therapeutic role of UA in Covid-19. However, taken into account 
      that Covid-19 is yet to be investigating for further evaluations, therefore, 
      clinical trials are recommended regarding use and dose of UA in Covid-19 
      treatment, as well as secondary effects.

AB  - Post-Covid pulmonary fibrosis is evident following severe COVID-19. There is an 
      urgent need to identify the cellular and pathophysiological characteristics of 
      chronic lung squeals of Covid-19 for the development of future preventive and/or 
      therapeutic interventions. Tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells can mediate 
      local immune protection against infections and cancer. Less beneficially, lung 
      T(RM) cells cause chronic airway inflammation and fibrosis by stimulating 
      pathologic inflammation. The effects of Janus kinase (JAK), an inducer pathway of 
      cytokine storm, inhibition on acute Covid-19 cases have been previously 
      evaluated. Here, we propose that Tofacitinib by targeting the CD8(+) T(RM) cells 
      could be a potential candidate for the treatment of chronic lung diseases induced 
      by acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Although Gulf War Illness (GWI), fibromyalgia (FM), myalgic 
      encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and long COVID have distinct 
      origins, in this article we have reviewed evidence that these disorders comprise 
      a group of so-called low-energy associated disorders with overlapping common 
      symptoms underlying pathology. In particular, evidence for mitochondrial 
      dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, immune dysregulation, neuroendocrine 
      dysfunction, disrupted brain-gut-microbiome axis, apoptosis/ferroptosis and 
      telomere shortening as common features in the pathogenesis of these disorders has 
      been identified. Given the role of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in promoting normal 
      mitochondrial function, as an antioxidant, antiinflammatory and antiapoptotic and 
      antiferroptotic agent, there is a rationale for supplementary CoQ10 in the 
      management of these disorders. The reported benefits of supplementary CoQ10 
      administration in GWI, FM, ME/CFS and long COVID have been reviewed; the 
      potential benefit of supplementary CoQ10 in reducing telomere shortening and 
      improving the efficiency of stem cell transfer relevant has also been identified 
      as promising therapeutic strategies in these disorders. This review advances 
      beyond previous systematic reviews and consensus statements on overlapping 
      similar symptoms and underlying biological pathomechanisms in these complex 
      disorders.

TI  - Olfactory Training for Post-COVID-19 Olfactory Dysfunction: A Meta-Analysis of 
      Efficacy and Combination Therapies.
LID - 10.3390/jcm14186578 [doi]
LID - 6578
AB  - Background/Objectives: This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the 
      effectiveness of olfactory training (OT) using standardized protocols in patients 
      with post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction. The objective was to assess whether OT, 
      compared to no treatment, placebo, or alternative therapies, improved olfactory 
      function as measured using validated smell tests, including UPSIT, Sniffin' 
      Sticks (TDI score), CCCRC, and B-SIT. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Web 
      of Science, and Ovid Medline was conducted through February 2025 in accordance 
      with PRISMA guidelines. Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the 
      inclusion criteria. Data were extracted on study characteristics (author, year, 
      country, design, sample size), population details (age, sex, post-COVID-19 
      cause), intervention type (training method, frequency, duration), comparators, 
      outcome measures (baseline and post-intervention olfactory scores), follow-up 
      duration, and reported adverse effects. The risk of bias was assessed using the 
      Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. Meta-analyses were performed 
      using RevMan and Open Meta-Analyst. Results: Olfactory training significantly 
      improved the olfactory scores compared to those of the controls. The greatest 
      improvement was observed when OT was combined with PEA-luteolin (MD = 4.62, 95% 
      CI: 2.17-7.06, p = 0.0002), followed by EDTA (MD = 2.33, 95% CI: 0.58-4.08, p = 
      0.009). Corticosteroids showed a borderline benefit (MD = 1.34, 95% CI: 
      0.01-2.67, p = 0.05), while alpha-lipoic acid had no significant effect. 
      Combination therapies were associated with higher recovery rates (RR = 1.65, 95% 
      CI: 1.13-2.42, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Olfactory training is an effective 
      treatment for post-COVID-19 smell dysfunction. When paired with specific adjunct 
      therapies, particularly PEA-luteolin, it may yield superior recovery outcomes. 
      Further large-scale, standardized RCTs are needed to define optimal treatment 
      protocols.

AB  - Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic 
      debilitating condition with no cure that shares commonality with long-COVID. This 
      review examines current understanding of long-COVID symptoms, characteristics of 
      the affected population, the connection with ME/CFS, and the potential for 
      salubrinal, an agent known for its influence on cellular stress pathways, to 
      mitigate these disorders It also describes the historical development and 
      mechanism of action of salubrinal, to mitigate endoplasmic reticulum 
      (ER)/cellular stress responses, that could potentially contribute to symptom 
      improvement in both ME/CFS and long-COVID patients. Further research and clinical 
      trials are warranted to advance our understanding of the potential role of 
      salubrinal in improving the quality of life for individuals with 
      long-COVID-related ME/CFS symptoms as well as ME/CFS patients.

TI  - Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis following a COVID-19 infection: case report.
PG  - 302-303
LID - 10.3855/jidc.16983 [doi]
AB  - The case of a 57-year-old male patient with jaundice, high-grade fever, and upper 
      abdominal pain who was recovering from a mild coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) 
      infection is reported. Laboratory analysis showed liver injury with high levels 
      of AST and ALT, as well as an elevated serum ferritin level. The patient 
      underwent a bone marrow biopsy which showed features of hemophagocytic 
      lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a systemic syndrome caused by immune activation. The 
      patient was successfully treated with etoposide and dexamethasone and kept on 
      maintenance therapy with cyclosporine, with resolution of the HLH. The discussion 
      highlights that COVID-19 infection may cause liver injury, and in severe cases, 
      patients may develop HLH as a cause for liver injury. The incidence of HLH in 
      adults with severe COVID-19 infection is estimated to be lower than 5%. The 
      association between HLH and COVID-19 infection has been studied due to 
      immunological hyperactivation. Signs such as persistent high fever, 
      hepatosplenomegaly, and progressive pancytopenia should raise suspicion for the 
      diagnosis of overlapping HLH. A specific approach using steroids and etoposide, 
      followed by maintenance therapy with cyclosporine, is proposed in the HLH-94 
      protocol as the mainstay of treatment. It is suggested that HLH should be 
      suspected in patients with laboratory signs of liver injury following COVID-19 
      infection, especially in patients with high-grade fever and a history of 
      rheumatic conditions.

TI  - Mobility of antipyretic drugs with different molecular structures in saturated 
      soil porous media.
PG  - 2092-2101
LID - 10.1039/d3em00358b [doi]
AB  - In the post-COVID-19 era, extensive quantities of antipyretic drugs are being 
      haphazardly released from households into the environment, which may pose 
      potential risks to ecological systems and human health. Identification of the 
      mobility behaviors of these compounds in the subsurface environment is crucial to 
      understand the environmental fate of these common contaminants. The mobility 
      properties of three broad-spectrum antipyretic drugs, including ibuprofen (IBF), 
      indometacin (IMC), and acetaminophen (APAP), in porous soil media, were 
      investigated in this study. The results showed that the mobility of the three 
      drugs (the background electrolyte was Na(+)) through the soil column followed the 
      order of APAP > IBF > IMC. The difference in the physicochemical characteristics 
      of various antipyretic drugs (e.g., the molecular structure and hydrophobicity) 
      could explain this trend. Unlike Na(+), Ca(2+) ions tended to serve as bridging 
      agents by linking the soil grains and antipyretic molecules, leading to the 
      relatively weak mobility behaviors of antipyretic drugs. Furthermore, for a given 
      antipyretic drug, the antipyretic mobility was promoted when the background 
      solution pH values were raised from 5.0 to 9.0. The phenomenon stemmed from the 
      improved electrostatic repulsion between the dissociated species of antipyretic 
      molecules and soil grains, as well as the weakened hydrophobic interactions 
      between antipyretic drugs and soil organic matter. Furthermore, a two-site 
      non-equilibrium transport model was used to estimate the mobility of antipyretic 
      drugs. The results obtained from this work provide vital information illustrating 
      the transport and retention of various antipyretic drugs in aquifers.

TI  - Potential Anti-Inflammatory and Anti-Fatigue Effects of an Oral Food Supplement 
      in Long COVID Patients.
LID - 10.3390/ph17040463 [doi]
LID - 463
AB  - Long coronavirus disease (COVID) syndrome leads to chronic inflammatory state 
      onset that can have a multisystem impact and compromise organ function. Moreover, 
      long COVID syndrome is often characterized by the presence of chronic fatigue, 
      which affects subjects' daily activities and worsens their quality of life. The 
      aim of our double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial (protocol code RS 
      150.21, approved on 4 November 2021) was to evaluate the beneficial effects of 
      the consumption of 2 cps/day, for two months, of an oral food supplement (OFS), 
      based on Echinacea angustifolia, rosehip, propolis, royal jelly and zinc, in long 
      COVID patients, compared to a two-month placebo period. The OFS's vitamin C 
      content was equal to 22.17 mg/g (8.87 mg/capsule). The OFS's total polyphenol 
      content was 43.98 mg/g gallic acid equivalents. At the end of the in vivo study, 
      we highlighted a significant decrease in the inflammatory parameters in the OFS 
      period, compared to the placebo period (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, p = 
      0.0455; monocyte to-lymphocyte ratio, p = 0.0005; C-reactive protein, p = 
      0.0145). Our study also highlighted a significant increase in vitamin D serum 
      values (p = 0.0005) and, at the same time, an improvement in patients' life 
      quality and a reduction in fatigue, monitored by the fatigue severity scale. This 
      study showed the OFS's beneficial effects on the inflammatory state, fatigue and 
      quality of life in long COVID patients.

TI  - Predictive Role of Cytokine and Adipokine Panel in Hospitalized COVID-19 
      Patients: Evaluation of Disease Severity, Survival and Lung Sequelae.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may determine a multisystemic chronic 
      syndrome after resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a significant percentage of 
      patients. Persistent cytokine dysregulation can contribute to long-lasting 
      inflammation and tissue damage, resulting in the diverse, often debilitating 
      symptoms experienced by some patients (so-called long COVID syndrome). The aim of 
      our study was to evaluate the value of a panel of serum biomarkers of severity 
      and prognosis in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and also as predictive 
      factors for the development of post-COVID lung sequelae after discharge from the 
      hospital. All blood sampling was performed in the first 24 h after admission to 
      the hospital. Serum analyte concentrations of IL-4, IL-2, CXCL10 (IP-10), IL-1β, 
      TNF-α, CCL2 (MCP-1), IL-17A, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-12p70 and TGF-β1 were 
      quantified by bead-based multiplex LEGENDplex™ analysis and commercially 
      available ELISA kits. A total of 108 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the 
      study. Comparative analysis of these proteins showed higher levels of TGF-β and 
      IL-6 and lower levels of RBP-4 and IL-10 in the severe group. Age, adiponectin, 
      IL-8 and IL-32 resulted as the best predictors for survival. Moreover, IL-1β, 
      IL17A, TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-4 and IL-6 were significantly higher in patients who 
      showed HRCT evidence of fibrotic interstitial alterations at follow-up than 
      patients who did not. The initial inflammatory status of patients on admission to 
      the hospital with COVID-19, as reflected by the present panel of adipose 
      tissue-related biomarkers and cytokines, offered insights into medium-term 
      prognosis.

TI  - Effects of l-Arginine Plus Vitamin C Supplementation on l-Arginine Metabolism in 
      Adults with Long COVID: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24065078 [doi]
LID - 5078
AB  - Altered l-arginine metabolism has been described in patients with COVID-19 and 
      has been associated with immune and vascular dysfunction. In the present 
      investigation, we determined the serum concentrations of l-arginine, citrulline, 
      ornithine, monomethyl-l-arginine (MMA), and symmetric and asymmetric 
      dimethylarginine (SDMA, ADMA) in adults with long COVID at baseline and after 
      28-days of l-arginine plus vitamin C or placebo supplementation enrolled in a 
      randomized clinical trial, compared with a group of adults without previous 
      history of SARS-CoV-2-infection. l-arginine-derived markers of nitric oxide (NO) 
      bioavailability (i.e., l-arginine/ADMA, l-arginine/citrulline+ornithine, and 
      l-arginine/ornithine) were also assayed. Partial least squares discriminant 
      analysis (PLS-DA) models were built to characterize systemic l-arginine 
      metabolism and assess the effects of the supplementation. PLS-DA allowed 
      discrimination of participants with long COVID from healthy controls with 80.2 ± 
      3.0% accuracy. Lower markers of NO bioavailability were found in participants 
      with long COVID. After 28 days of l-arginine plus vitamin C supplementation, 
      serum l-arginine concentrations and l-arginine/ADMA increased significantly 
      compared with placebo. This supplement may therefore be proposed as a remedy to 
      increase NO bioavailability in people with long COVID.

      Disease.
PG  - 107-113
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgac550 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Several case reports of Graves' disease (GD) occurrence after COVID-19 
      vaccination that are possibly related to the autoimmune syndrome induced by 
      adjuvants (ASIA) were published recently. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to 
      evaluate possible distinctive features in the presentation and clinical course of 
      patients with GD occurring early (within 4 weeks) after COVID-19 vaccination who 
      attended our Endocrine Unit in 2021. METHODS: Patients with a first episode of GD 
      attending a tertiary endocrine center between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 
      2021, were included. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients with a first episode of GD were 
      seen in 2021: 20 (31.2%) of them had onset within 4 weeks following vaccine 
      administration. Compared with the other 44 patients, the 20 patients with 
      postvaccine early-onset (PoVEO) GD were older (median age 51 years vs 35 years, P 
      = .003) and more likely to be male (40.0% vs 13.6%, P = .018). At diagnosis, the 
      biochemical and immune profiles were similar between the 2 groups. However, at 3 
      months after starting methimazole, patients with PoVEO GD had significantly lower 
      thyrotropin receptor antibody titer and were taking lower doses of methimazole 
      than the other patients with GD. None in the PoVEO group had sustained free 
      triiodothyronine elevation. CONCLUSION: This relatively large series suggests 
      that in 2021 PoVEO GD may be a new nosologic entity representing one-third of 
      patients evaluated for new-onset GD in our center. Distinctive features included 
      older age at onset, higher male prevalence, and a better initial biochemical and 
      immunologic response to treatment. Further studies are warranted to clinically 
      and biochemically differentiate these cases from sporadically occurring GD.

      thrombotic disease prevalent in up to 30% SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Early 
      work suggests that aspirin could prevent COVID-19 related thromboembolic 
      disorders in some studies but not others. This study leverages data from the 
      largest integrated healthcare system in the United States to better understand 
      this association. Our objective was to evaluate the incidence and risk of 
      COVID-19 associated acute thromboembolic disorders and the potential impact of 
      aspirin. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study utilized national 
      electronic health record data from the Veterans Health Administration. 334,374 
      Veterans who tested positive for COVID-19 from March 2, 2020, to June 13, 2022, 
      were included, 81,830 of whom had preexisting aspirin prescription prior to their 
      COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with and without aspirin prescriptions were matched 
      and the odds of post-COVID acute thromboembolic disorders were assessed. RESULTS: 
      10.1% of Veterans had a documented thromboembolic disorder within 12 months 
      following their COVID-19 diagnosis. Those with specific comorbidities were at 
      greatest risk. Preexisting aspirin prescription was associated with a significant 
      decrease risk of post-COVID-19 thromboembolic disorders, including pulmonary 
      embolism (OR [95% CI]: 0.69 [0.65, 0.74]) and deep vein thrombosis (OR [95% CI]: 
      0.76 [0.69, 0.83], but an increased risk of acute arterial diseases, including 
      ischemic stroke (OR [95% CI]: 1.54 [1.46, 1.60]) and acute ischemic heart disease 
      (1.33 [1.26, 1.39]). CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrated that preexisting aspirin 
      prescription prior to COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with significantly 
      decreased risk of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism but increased 
      risk of acute arterial disease. The risk of arterial disease may be associated 
      with increased COVID-19 prothrombotic effects superimposed on preexisting chronic 
      cardiovascular disease for which aspirin was already prescribed. Prospective 
      clinical trials may help to further assess the efficacy of aspirin use prior to 
      COVID-19 diagnosis for the prevention of post-COVID-19 thromboembolic disorders.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), poses a significant threat to global public health. 
      Despite reports of liver injury during viral disease, the occurrence and detailed 
      mechanisms underlying the development of secondary exogenous liver injury, 
      particularly in relation to changes in metabolic enzymes, remain to be fully 
      elucidated. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the mechanisms 
      underlying SARS-CoV-2-induced molecular alterations in hepatic metabolism and the 
      consequent secondary liver injury resulting from alcohol exposure. We 
      investigated the potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on alcohol-induced 
      liver injury in Keratin 18 promoter-human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 
      (K18-hACE2) transgenic mice. Mice were intranasally infected with 1 × 10(2) PFU 
      of SARS-CoV-2. Following a 14 d recovery period from infection, the recovered 
      mice were orally administered alcohol at 6 g/kg. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      aggravated alcohol-induced liver injury based on increased alanine 
      aminotransferase levels and cytoplasmic vacuolation. Interestingly, infected mice 
      exhibited lower blood alcohol levels and higher levels of acetaldehyde, a toxic 
      alcohol metabolite, compared to uninfected mice after the same period of alcohol 
      consumption. Along with alterations of several metabolic process-related terms 
      identified through RNA sequencing, notably, upregulation of cytochrome P450 2E1 
      (CYP2E1) and CYP1A2 was observed in infected mice compared to control value prior 
      to alcohol exposure, with no significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 on intestinal 
      damage. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha persistently showed upregulated expression in 
      the infected mice; it also enhanced aryl hydrocarbon receptor and Sp1 expressions 
      and their binding activity to Cyp1a2 and Cyp2e1 promoters, respectively, in 
      hepatocytes, promoting the upregulation of their transcription. Our findings 
      suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection exacerbates alcohol-induced liver injury 
      through the transcriptional activation of Cyp1a2 and Cyp2e1, providing valuable 
      insights for the development of clinical recommendations on long COVID.

TI  - Adaptations to Opioid Use Disorder Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National 
      Survey of Prescribers.
PG  - 505-513
LID - 10.1097/ADM.0000000000000948 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Among opioid use disorder (OUD)-treating providers, to characterize 
      adaptations used to provide medications for OUD (MOUD) and factors associated 
      with desire to continue virtual visits post-COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In a 
      national electronic survey of OUD-treating prescribers (July-August 2020), 
      analyses restricted to X-waivered buprenorphine prescribers providing outpatient, 
      longitudinal care for adults with OUD, quantitative and qualitative analyses of 
      survey items and free text responses were conducted. RESULTS: Among 797 
      respondents, 49% were men, 57% ≥50 years, 76% White, 68% physicians. Respondents 
      widely used virtual visits to continue prescribing existing MOUD regimens (79%), 
      provide behavioral healthcare (71%), and initiate new MOUD prescriptions (49%). 
      Most prescribers preferred to continue/expand use of virtual visits after 
      COVID-19. In multivariable models, factors associated with preference to 
      continue/expand virtual visits to initiate MOUD postpandemic were treating a 
      moderate number of patients prepandemic (aOR = 1.67; 95%[CI] = 1.06,2.62) and 
      practicing in an urban setting (aOR = 2.17; 95%[CI] = 1.48,3.18). Prescribing 
      buprenorphine prepandemic (aOR = 2.06; 95%[CI] = 1.11,3.82) and working in an 
      academic medical center (aOR = 2.47; 95%[CI] = 1.30,4.68) were associated with 
      preference to continue/expand use of virtual visits to continue MOUD 
      postpandemic. Prescribing naltrexone extended-release injection prepandemic was 
      associated with preference to continue/expand virtual visits to initiate and 
      continue MOUD (aOR = 1.51; 95%[CI] = 1.10,2.07; aOR = 1.74; 95%[CI] = 1.19,2.54). 
      Qualitative findings suggest that providers appreciated virtual visits due to 
      convenience and patient accessibility, but were concerned about liability and 
      technological barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Surveyed prescribers widely used virtual 
      visits to provide MOUD with overall positive experiences. Future studies should 
      evaluate the impact of virtual visits on MOUD access and retention and clinical 
      outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Discordance between real-world prescribing patterns and global 
      treatment guidelines for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD) with inhaled single or dual long-acting bronchodilator maintenance therapy 
      is increasingly being reported in the literature, particularly with regard to 
      addition of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Patient-related factors, e.g. 
      inhalation technique and inspiratory flow, are key to disease control in COPD. 
      Treatment discordance and patient-related factors can lead to high-cost side 
      effects and sub-optimal treatment benefit; furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has 
      led to new challenges in COPD management. AREAS COVERED: This article summarizes 
      a series of presentations sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim and delivered at the 
      annual CHEST congress 2021 (October 17-20, 2021) that explored new insights into 
      the optimal management of COPD. EXPERT OPINION/COMMENTARY: There is a concerning 
      high degree of discordance with GOLD recommendations. Dual therapy without 
      addition of ICS does not increase exacerbation risk and could reduce pneumonia 
      risk, and unnecessary prescription of triple therapy has financial implications. 
      Clinic-based spirometry may not reflect the home setting, and training is 
      required; inhalers that operate independently of users' inhalation profiles 
      should be considered. Integration of digital healthcare solutions into clinical 
      studies is suggested in the post-COVID setting, although further evaluation is 
      required.

TI  - Silexan in anxiety, depression, and related disorders: pharmacological background 
      and clinical data.
PG  - 1621-1635
LID - 10.1007/s00406-024-01923-8 [doi]
AB  - We present a narrative review of clinical trials investigating the anxiolytic and 
      antidepressant effects of silexan, an active substance derived from lavender oil 
      and summarize nonclinical findings from pharmacological studies supporting its 
      therapeutic use. Six studies investigated the efficacy of the lavender oil in 
      patients with subthreshold and generalized anxiety disorders as well as in mixed 
      anxiety and depressive disorder (MADD). Furthermore, we present data indicating 
      that silexan may influence sleep quality as well as anxiety or depressive 
      disorders in individuals with post-COVID-19. Silexan taken orally at a daily dose 
      of 80 mg for 10 weeks was significantly superior to placebo in reducing psychic 
      and somatic symptoms of anxiety and was as effective as 0.5 mg/d lorazepam and 
      20 mg/d paroxetine. In patients with mild or moderate major depression, silexan 
      was superior to placebo and comparably effective to 50 mg/d sertraline. 
      Significant antidepressant effects were also observed in MADD and depression 
      co-morbid with anxiety. The herbal product had a beneficial effect on activities 
      of daily living and health-related quality of life. Adverse events associated 
      with silexan in clinical trials were limited to eructation and mild, transient 
      gastrointestinal complaints. The herbal product was not associated with drug 
      interactions, sedation, sleep disturbance, dependence and abuse potential, sexual 
      dysfunction, weight gain or withdrawal symptoms. Silexan was therefore safe and 
      effective in subthreshold and syndromal anxiety disorders and in major 
      depression.

TI  - Time to Sustained Recovery Among Outpatients With COVID-19 Receiving Montelukast 
      vs Placebo: The ACTIV-6 Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e2439332
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.39332 [doi]
LID - e2439332
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The effect of montelukast in reducing symptom duration among 
      outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the 
      effectiveness of montelukast compared with placebo in treating outpatients with 
      mild to moderate COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized 
      clinical trial (Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines 
      [ACTIV]-6) was conducted from January 27 through June 23, 2023, during the 
      circulation of Omicron subvariants. Participants aged 30 years or older with 
      confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 2 or more acute COVID-19 symptoms for less 
      than 7 days were included across 104 US sites. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were 
      randomized 1:1 to receive montelukast, 10 mg once daily, or matched placebo for 
      14 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to sustained 
      recovery (defined as ≥3 consecutive days without symptoms). Secondary outcomes 
      included time to death; time to hospitalization or death; a composite of health 
      care utilization events (hospitalization, urgent care clinic visit, emergency 
      department visit, or death); COVID-19 clinical progression scale score; and 
      difference in mean time unwell. A modified intention-to-treat approach was used 
      for the analysis. RESULTS: Among 1250 participants who were randomized and 
      received the study drug or placebo, the median age was 53 years (IQR, 42-62 
      years), 753 (60.2%) were female, and 704 (56.3%) reported receiving 2 or more 
      doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Among 628 participants who received montelukast 
      and 622 who received placebo, differences in time to sustained recovery were not 
      observed (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.02; 95% credible interval [CrI], 
      0.92-1.12; P = .63 for efficacy). Unadjusted median time to sustained recovery 
      was 10 days (95% CI, 10-11 days) in both groups. No deaths occurred, and 
      hospitalizations were reported for 2 participants (0.3%) in each group; the 
      composite of health care utilization events was reported for 18 participants 
      (2.9%) in the montelukast group and 18 (2.9%) in the placebo group (AHR, 1.01; 
      95% CrI, 0.45-1.84; P = .48 for efficacy). Five participants (0.4%) experienced 
      serious adverse events (3 [0.5%] in the montelukast group and 2 [0.3%] in the 
      placebo group). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of 
      outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, treatment with montelukast did not 
      reduce duration of COVID-19 symptoms. These findings do not support the use of 
      montelukast for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04885530.

TI  - Donepezil for Fatigue and Psychological Symptoms in Post-COVID-19 Condition: A 
      Randomized Clinical Trial.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Fatigue is the most commonly reported symptom of post-COVID-19 
      condition (also known as long COVID) and impairs various functions. One of the 
      underlying mechanisms may be intracerebral inflammation due to decreases in 
      acetylcholine levels. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of donepezil 
      hydrochloride, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on post-COVID-19 fatigue and 
      psychological symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter, 
      double-blind randomized clinical trial was performed in Japan. Between December 
      14, 2022, and March 31, 2024, adult patients within 52 weeks of the onset of 
      COVID-19 and with a global binary fatigue score of 4 or greater on the Chalder 
      Fatigue Scale were randomized into a donepezil or a placebo group. EXPOSURE: The 
      intervention was conducted during a 3-week period, with donepezil hydrochloride 
      being administered at a dosage of 3 mg/d for the first week and then 5 mg/d for 2 
      weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a change in the 
      Chalder Fatigue Scale score and the absolute score 3 weeks after the initiation 
      of treatment. Other outcomes at 3 and 8 weeks, such as psychological symptoms and 
      quality of life, were evaluated as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 120 
      eligible patients were enrolled and 10 withdrew or were lost to follow-up; 
      therefore, 110 patients (55 in each group) were included in the efficacy analysis 
      (64 [58%] female; mean [SD] age, 43 [12] years). No significant differences were 
      observed in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. The baseline-adjusted 
      estimating treatment effect of donepezil, measured as the mean difference on 
      Chalder Fatigue Scale scores at 3 weeks, was 0.34 (95% CI, -2.23 to 2.91), 
      showing no significant effect of the intervention (P = .79). Scores for the 
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, EuroQol 
      5-Dimension 5-Level Version, Patient Health Questionnaire, and Daily Health 
      Status at 3 and 8 weeks were similar. No serious adverse events occurred in 
      either group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of 
      donepezil to treat post-COVID-19 condition, the efficacy for fatigue and 
      psychological symptoms was not confirmed in a general population. The development 
      of effective therapeutics for post-COVID-19 symptoms is needed, and more clinical 
      trials should be conducted in the future. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Japan Registry of 
      Clinical Trials Identifier: jRCT 2031220510.

TI  - Fermented Carica papaya and Morinda citrifolia as Perspective Food Supplements 
      for the Treatment of Post-COVID Symptoms: Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical 
      Laboratory Study.

AB  - Food supplements based on fermented Carica papaya and Morinda citrifolia, known 
      for their immune modulating, redox balancing, and anti-inflammatory effects, were 
      added to conventional treatment protocols prescribed to patients recovering after 
      severe and moderate COVID-19 disease in order to alleviate long-lasting 
      post-COVID symptoms. A randomized single-center placebo-controlled clinical 
      laboratory study was designed and performed (total number of participants 188, 
      with delta variant of virus 157, with omicron 31). Clinical statuses were 
      assessed using computer tomography, electrocardiography, a questionnaire, and 
      physical endurance. Plasma cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, and INF-gamma), 
      nitrate/nitrite ratio, antioxidant activity (AOA), and polymorphonuclear 
      leukocyte (PMN) ATP levels were determined before and 20 days following the 
      addition of 28 g of fermented supplements twice per day. The capacity of PMN to 
      phagocyte and the oral-nasal-pharyngeal microbiota were assessed. Clinical 
      symptoms, IL-6, IL-8, and nitric oxide metabolites diminished significantly 
      compared to the placebo group and their background expression. The PMN capacity 
      to phagocyte, AOA, and ATP content remarkably increased. The 
      oral-nasal-pharyngeal microbiota were unchanged. On these grounds, we suggest 
      that fermented tropical fruits could efficiently diminish post-COVID clinical 
      symptoms through several immune-modulating, redox balancing, and pro-energy 
      mechanisms.

TI  - Effectiveness of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir on post-COVID-19 
      outcomes among outpatients: a target trial emulation investigation.

AB  - Limited studies compared the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 
      molnupiravir against a control group on post-COVID-19 conditions. Our study 
      examined the association of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir with 
      post-acute mortality and hospitalizations among outpatients using real-world 
      outpatient records of COVID-19 designated clinics in Hong Kong. This is an 
      observational study using a target trial emulation framework, involving 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus no antiviral treatment (Trial 1) and molnupiravir 
      versus no antiviral treatment (Trial 2). Outcomes included post-acute mortality, 
      all-cause hospitalization, and hospitalization due to 13 selected sequelae. 
      Relative effectiveness was assessed by comparing the cumulative incidence between 
      two groups, reported as relative risk (RR), along with risk differences (RD) 
      during day 0-30, 31-180, and 181-360. After screening, 140,477 and 96,030 
      patients were included in Trial 1 and 2, respectively. Compared with no 
      treatment, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-treated patients exhibited a significantly 
      lower risk of post-acute mortality (31-180 days: RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.96; RD, 
      0.20%; 181-360 days: RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50-0.82; RD, 0.32%) and all-cause 
      hospitalization (31-180 days: RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.88; RD, 1.11%; 181-360 
      days: RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.78-0.89; RD, 1.18%). Patients receiving molnupiravir 
      had a lower risk of 30-day mortality, but no significant beneficial effect was 
      observed for the post-acute outcomes. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the 
      effectiveness of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in reducing post-COVID-19 outcomes among 
      outpatients. While we observed the short-term effectiveness of molnupiravir in 
      reducing mortality, no protective effect on long-term post-COVID-19 outcomes was 
      observed.

AB  - Nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir received Emergency Use Authorization for treating 
      mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients. Its efficacy against the Omicron 
      variant of SARS-CoV-2 remains uncertain. This retrospective cohort study assessed 
      the effect of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in preventing severe disease progression and 
      long COVID symptoms after acute COVID-19 in non-hospitalized adults. SALAMA 
      medical records from Dubai's COVID-19 healthcare centers between May 22, 2022, 
      and April 30, 2023, were used to identify 7290 eligible patients, 9.6% of whom 
      received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Treatment was associated with a notable 
      reduction in COVID-19-related hospitalizations (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] of 
      0.39; 95% CI, 0.18-0.85) by day 28 of symptom onset. Moreover, 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with fewer long COVID symptoms (adjusted HR 
      of 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19-0.95). This suggests the significant effectiveness of 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir against the Omicron variant, reducing both severe and 
      long-term COVID-19 symptoms.

TI  - Effectiveness of Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir Against the Development of Post-COVID-19 
      Conditions Among U.S. Veterans : A Target Trial Emulation.
PG  - 1486-1497
LID - 10.7326/M23-1394 [doi]
LID - M23-1394
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been linked to the development of many post-COVID-19 
      conditions (PCCs) after acute infection. Limited information is available on the 
      effectiveness of oral antivirals used to treat acute COVID-19 in preventing the 
      development of PCCs. OBJECTIVE: To measure the effectiveness of outpatient 
      treatment of COVID-19 with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in preventing PCCs. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective target trial emulation study comparing matched cohorts receiving 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus no treatment. SETTING: Veterans Health 
      Administration (VHA). PARTICIPANTS: Nonhospitalized veterans in VHA care who were 
      at risk for severe COVID-19 and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during January 
      through July 2022. INTERVENTION: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment for acute 
      COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Cumulative incidence of 31 potential PCCs at 31 to 180 
      days after treatment or a matched index date, including cardiac, pulmonary, 
      renal, thromboembolic, gastrointestinal, neurologic, mental health, 
      musculoskeletal, endocrine, and general conditions and symptoms. RESULTS: 
      Eighty-six percent of the participants were male, with a median age of 66 years, 
      and 17.5% were unvaccinated. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between 
      participants treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and matched untreated 
      comparators. No differences were observed between participants treated with 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n = 9593) and their matched untreated comparators in the 
      incidence of most PCCs examined individually or grouped by organ system, except 
      for lower combined risk for venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism 
      (subhazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.44 to 0.97]; cumulative incidence difference, 
      -0.29 percentage points [CI, -0.52 to -0.05 percentage points]). LIMITATIONS: 
      Ascertainment of PCCs using International Classification of Diseases, 10th 
      Revision, codes may be inaccurate. Evaluation of many outcomes could have 
      resulted in spurious associations with combined thromboembolic events by chance. 
      CONCLUSION: Out of 31 potential PCCs, only combined thromboembolic events seemed 
      to be reduced by nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: U.S. Department

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long COVID is characterized by the persistence of symptoms among 
      individuals who are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The enduring impact of 
      these long-term effects on the health and well-being of those affected cannot be 
      denied. METHODS: 470 patients with SARS-CoV-2 were consecutively recruited in 
      this longitudinal study. The participants were entered into moderate, severe, and 
      critical groups. 235 out of 470 participants were female. The levels of fasting 
      blood sugar (FBS), alanine transaminase (SGPT), aspartate aminotransferase 
      (SGOT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine (Cr), urea, uric acid (UA), and 
      total protein (TP) were measured during hospitalization and again at one and 
      three months after infection. The levels of Zn and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were 
      also measured only during hospitalization. RESULTS: COVID-19 severity was 
      associated with high levels of glucose, urea, Cr, ALT, AST, ALP, and HbA1c, and 
      low levels of Zn, UA, and TP. There were significant sex differences for these 
      markers at all three-time points. Glucose, urea, Cr, ALT, AST, and ALP all 
      decreased three months after infection, whereas the levels of UA and TP returned 
      towards normal. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection affects the levels of multiple 
      biochemical factors in a gender-dependent manner. The biochemical changes become 
      more tangible with increasing disease severity, and several of these predict 
      mortality. Levels begin to return to normal after the acute phase of the disease, 
      but in some individuals, at three months, several markers were still not within 
      the normal range. Whether the trajectory of these changes can predict long COVID 
      requires further testing.

AB  - The global prevalence of fungal infections is alarming in both the pre- and post- 
      COVID period. Due to a limited number of antifungal drugs, there are hurdles in 
      treatment strategies for fungal infections due to toxic potential, drug 
      interactions, and the development of fungal resistance. All the antifungal 
      targets (existing and newer) and pipeline molecules showing promise against these 
      targets are reviewed. The objective was to predict or repurpose phyto-based 
      antifungal compounds based on a dual target inhibition approach (Sterol-14-α- 
      demethylase and HSP-90) using a case study. In pursuit of repurposing the 
      phytochemicals as antifungal agents, a team of researchers visited Aravalli 
      Biodiversity Park (ABP), Delhi, India, to collect information on available 
      medicinal plants. From 45 plants, a total of 1149 ligands were collected, and 
      virtual screening was performed using Schrodinger Suite 2016 software to get 83 
      hits against both the target proteins: Sterol-14-α-demethylase and HSP-90. After 
      analysis of docking results, ligands were selected based on their interaction 
      against both the target proteins and comparison with respective standard ligands 
      (fluconazole and ganetespib). We have selected Isocarthamidin, Quercetin and 
      Boeravinone B based on their docking score and binding interaction against the 
      HSP-90 (Docking Score -9.65, -9.22 and -9.21, respectively) and 14-α-demethylase 
      (Docking Score -9.19, -10.76 and -9.74 respectively). The docking protocol was 
      validated and MM/GBSA studies depicted better stability of selected three ligands 
      (Isocarthamidin, Quercetin, Boeravinone B) complex as compared to standard 
      complex. Further, MD simulation studies were performed using the Desmond (67) 
      software package version 2018-4. All the findings are presented as a case study 
      for the prediction of dual targets for the repurposing of certain phytochemicals 
      as antifungal agents.

AB  - COVID-19 skin manifestations are multifaceted, ranging from urticaria, 
      morbilliform or papulovesicular rash, livedoid purpuric lesions, and to 
      pseudochilblains (also called COVID toes). Recent insights into the mechanism of 
      these manifestations have highlighted that morbilliform, papulovesicular, and 
      livedoid/purpuric rashes are related to virus-induced endothelial cell damage and 
      linked to moderate-to-severe disease, whereas pseudochilblains are related to an 
      exaggerated IFN-1 production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells in protected 
      individuals. In this paper, we will review the clinical and physiopathological 
      features of cutaneous COVID-19 manifestations in relation to the direct viral 
      cytopathic effects and dysregulated IFN-1 responses. We will also review the 
      emerging insights into post-COVID conditions (also termed long COVID) and how 
      they may be implicated in the persistence of COVID-19-associated skin diseases.

TI  - Effect of fluvoxamine on preventing neuropsychiatric symptoms of post COVID 
      syndrome in mild to moderate patients, a randomized placebo-controlled 
      double-blind clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Shortly after the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a 
      considerable number of recovered patients reported persisting symptoms, 
      especially neuropsychological manifestations, which were later named post-COVID 
      syndrome (PCS). Immune dysregulation was suggested as one of the main mechanisms 
      for PCS. Fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is 
      mostly used to treat depression, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive 
      disorder, has been suggested as an anti-COVID drug due to its anti-inflammatory 
      effects, mainly through the sigma-1 receptor. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate 
      fluvoxamine's effect on PCS neuropsychiatric symptoms. METHOD: In this 
      double-blind randomized clinical trial, we included confirmed mild to moderate 
      COVID-19 outpatients using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by an infectious 
      disease specialist. The presence of severe COVID-19 symptoms was evaluated by the 
      infectious disease specialist and included dyspnea, SpO2 < 94% on room air, 
      PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mm Hg, a respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, and lung 
      infiltrates > 50%. Then we performed permuted block randomization and assigned 
      patients 1:1 into two groups to either receive fluvoxamine 100 mg tablet or a 
      placebo daily for 10 days. Eligible patients were evaluated after 12 weeks for 
      the presence of fatigue, as the primary, and other PCS symptoms as secondary 
      outcomes. RESULTS: We screened a total of 486 patients from March to June 2022. 
      After 12 weeks, 42 patients receiving fluvoxamine and 43 patients receiving 
      Placebo were evaluated for PCS. Patients had a mean age of 38.5 ± 14.1 and 48% of 
      them were women. Fatigue was significantly lower in the fluvoxamine group 
      (p-value 0.026). No significant differences were observed in other symptoms. 
      CONCLUSION: We concluded that taking fluvoxamine during active COVID-19 can 
      reduce the chance of fatigue but the advantage of fluvoxamine was not observed 
      for other symptoms. Further studies are necessary to confirm these preliminary 
      results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Post COVID-19 syndrome (PC-19S) appears to be independent of acute 
      illness severity and humoral response. The involvement of the autonomic nervous 
      system (ANS), expressed by dysautonomia, has been hypothesized as a contributor. 
      Several studies have associated the therapeutic effects of local anesthetics (LA) 
      to their action on the ANS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
      report of therapeutic injections with LA linked to clinical improvement in a 
      patient with PC-19S. PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSES: This was a 54-year-old-man 
      with postCOVID-19 symptoms lasting 14 weeks, including fatigue, breathlessness, 
      diarrhea, muscle pain, and emotional lability. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME: 
      Injections of 0.5% procaine in the stellate ganglion (SG) and sphenopalatine 
      ganglion (SPG), and in clinically relevant points in the scalp, thorax, and 
      abdomen were performed 3 times over 3 months. The patient reported progressive 
      improvement and was asymptomatic upon completing the treatment. Prescribed 
      medications were discontinued. The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) score 
      showed significant improvement across all SF-36-domains. CONCLUSION: 
      Subanesthetic doses of LA injected in clinically relevant points led to rapid and 
      complete symptom resolution in this patient with PC-19S. Targeted LA injections 
      may have therapeutic benefits in PC-19S and in other chronic diseases linked to 
      stress and inflammation.

AB  - We tested the hypothesis that post-COVID-19 adults (PC) would have impaired 
      cutaneous nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation compared to controls (CON). We 
      performed a cross-sectional study including 10 (10 F/0 M, 69 ± 7 years) CON and 7 
      (2 F/5 M, 66 ± 8 years) PC (223 ± 154 days post-diagnosis). COVID-19 symptoms 
      severity (survey) was assessed (0-100 scale for 18 common symptoms). NO-dependent 
      cutaneous vasodilation was induced by a standardized 42°C local heating protocol 
      and quantified via perfusion of 15 mM NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester during the 
      plateau of the heating response (intradermal microdialysis). Red blood cell flux 
      was measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry. Cutaneous vascular conductance 
      (CVC = flux/mm Hg) was presented as a percentage of maximum (28 mM sodium 
      nitroprusside +43°C). All data are means ± SD. The local heating plateau (CON: 
      71 ± 23% CVC(max) vs. PC: 81 ± 16% CVC(max) , p = 0.77) and NO-dependent 
      vasodilation (CON: 56 ± 23% vs. PC: 60 ± 22%, p = 0.77) were not different 
      between groups. In the PC group neither time since diagnosis nor peak symptom 
      severity (46 ± 18 AU) correlated with NO-dependent vasodilation (r < 0.01, 
      p = 0.99 and r = 0.42, p = 0.35, respectively). In conclusion, middle-aged and 
      older adults who have had COVID-19 did not have impaired NO-dependent cutaneous 
      vasodilation. Additionally, in this cohort of PC, neither time since diagnosis 
      nor symptomology were related to microvascular function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long COVID have posed a global health burden since the COVID-19 
      pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combined 
      plant extract (CPE) formulation, containing Citrus aurantifolia, Tiliacora 
      triandra, Cannabis sativa, Alpinia galanga, and Piper nigrum, in participants 
      with long COVID. A newly developed long COVID symptom questionnaire was used to 
      evaluate outcomes. METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 
      trial was conducted at the College of Pharmacy, Rangsit University, Thailand. 
      Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a CPE supplement 
      (4500 mg/day) or a placebo for 7 days. Primary outcomes were changes in 
      C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the total symptom score (ranging from 0 to 57 
      points). Secondary outcomes included full recovery/improvement of long COVID 
      symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and adverse events. RESULTS: A 
      total of 66 participants were enrolled, with 33 in each group. The CPE supplement 
      did not significantly reduce CRP levels, with a median difference (MD) (95 % CI) 
      of -0.05 (-0.49, 0.39) mg/L compared to placebo. However, the CPE group showed a 
      reduction in the total symptom score [MD (95 % CI) of -4.00 (-7.58, -0.42)], and 
      a reduction in overall moderate to severe symptoms [RR (95 % CI) of 0.57 (0.35, 
      0.91)], moderate to severe fatigue [RR (95 % CI) of 0.25 (0.08, 0.81)], and 
      moderate to severe post-exertional malaise (PEM) [RR (95 % CI) of 0.35 (0.16, 
      0.78)]. Changes in HRQOL scores did not differ significantly between groups. 
      Adverse events were mostly mild and resolved by the end of the follow-up period. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests potential benefits of the CPE in alleviating 
      moderate to severe long COVID symptoms, particularly fatigue and PEM, with an 
      acceptable safety profile. However, larger-scale trials are necessary to validate 
      these findings, and assessing the reliability of the long COVID symptom 
      questionnaire is essential before its application in future studies. TRIAL

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a unique case and literature review of post COVID-19 
      associated transverse myelitis and dysautonomia with abnormal MRI and CSF 
      findings. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease have been reported to be associated 
      with several neurological manifestations such as stroke, Guillain-Barré syndrome, 
      meningoencephalitis amongst others. There are only few reported cases of 
      transverse myelitis with the novel coronavirus (n-CoV-2) and only one reported 
      case identifying dysautonomia in COVID-19 patient. Here, we identify a COVID-19 
      patient diagnosed with acute transverse myelitis in addition to dysautonomia 
      following with complete resolution of symptoms. METHOD: A retrospective chart 
      review of a patient diagnosed with post SARS-CoV-2 infection acute transverse 
      myelitis and dysautonomia, and a review of literature of all the reported cases 
      of transverse myelitis and COVID-19, from December 1st, 2019 till December 25th, 
      2020, was performed. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported 
      case of transverse myelitis and dysautonomia in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, who responded to intravenous methyl prednisone and bromocriptine. 
      Follow-up imaging of the spine showed complete resolution of the lesion. Further 
      studies would be recommended to identify the underlying correlation between 
      COVID-19 and transverse myelitis.

AB  - The unprecedented pandemic of COVID-19 swept millions of lives in a short period, 
      yet its menace continues among its survivors in the form of post-COVID syndrome. 
      An exponentially growing number of COVID-19 survivors suffer from cognitive 
      impairment, with compelling evidence of a trajectory of accelerated aging and 
      neurodegeneration. The novel and enigmatic nature of this yet-to-unfold pathology 
      demands extensive research seeking answers for both the molecular underpinnings 
      and potential therapeutic targets. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death, is 
      a strongly proposed underlying mechanism in post-COVID-19 aging and 
      neurodegeneration discourse. COVID-19 incites neuroinflammation, iron 
      dysregulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, antioxidant system 
      repression, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) disruption, and clock gene alteration. 
      These events pave the way for ferroptosis, which shows its signature in COVID-19, 
      premature aging, and neurodegenerative disorders. In the search for a treatment, 
      melatonin shines as a promising ferroptosis inhibitor with its repeatedly 
      reported safety and tolerability. According to various studies, melatonin has 
      proven efficacy in attenuating the severity of certain COVID-19 manifestations, 
      validating its reputation as an anti-viral compound. Melatonin has 
      well-documented anti-aging properties and combating neurodegenerative-related 
      pathologies. Melatonin can block the leading events of ferroptosis since it is an 
      efficient anti-inflammatory, iron chelator, antioxidant, angiotensin II 
      antagonist, and clock gene regulator. Therefore, we propose ferroptosis as the 
      culprit behind the post-COVID-19 trajectory of aging and neurodegeneration and 
      melatonin, a well-fitting ferroptosis inhibitor, as a potential treatment.

TI  - Brain fog with long covid and chemotherapy: systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1136/bmjment-2025-301969 [doi]
LID - e301969
AB  - QUESTION: What are the cognitive, functional and affective characteristics of 
      brain fog in individuals with long covid and following chemotherapy, and how are 
      these features assessed across studies? STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS: In March 
      2024, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of peer-reviewed studies 
      assessing cognition, function or mood in adults (≥18 years) with brain fog after 
      COVID-19 or chemotherapy. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched 
      systematically according to eligibility criteria to March 2024, with an update in 
      May 2025. Random-effects meta-analyses using the 'dmetar' package (V.0.0.9000) in 
      R V.4.3.1 were performed for studies comparing individuals with and without brain 
      fog. Bias was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Study Quality 
      Assessment Tools. FINDINGS: Of 3077 records screened, 65 studies met inclusion 
      criteria: 40 investigated brain fog in long covid and 25 in chemotherapy 
      populations. Considerable variation in assessment tools was observed. Montreal 
      Cognitive Assessment was the most common cognitive test in long covid studies; 
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function was most used in 
      chemotherapy studies. Nine long covid studies were eligible for meta-analysis. 
      Compared with controls, individuals with brain fog had significantly lower 
      cognitive performance (Hedge's g=-0.63, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.12), higher fatigue 
      (Hedge's g=2.64, 95% CI 0.41 to 4.86) and more depressive symptoms (Hedge's 
      g=1.48, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.55). Heterogeneity was high (I(2)>70%). No chemotherapy 
      studies were appropriate for meta-analysis, preventing direct comparison of brain 
      fog features between long covid and chemotherapy groups. CONCLUSIONS: Brain fog 
      in long covid and chemotherapy populations is associated with cognitive 
      complaints, fatigue and mood disturbance, though assessment methods differ 
      widely. To improve comparability and clinical understanding, we propose adoption 
      of consistent tools and definitions in future studies. This will be a crucial 
      step in generating findings that can be meaningfully compared across populations.

AB  - Cancer patients are considered highly susceptible to severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, it is not well known when 
      chemotherapy can be safely restarted in cancer patients after coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19). Here, we describe the case of an 18-year-old man diagnosed with 
      primary mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (PMNSGCT) in which 
      chemotherapy could be safely restarted after COVID-19. On day 11 of the third 
      cycle of bleomycin, etoposide, plus cisplatin (BEP), he was diagnosed with mild 
      COVID-19. On day 16 after the onset of COVID-19 (day 26 of third cycle of BEP), 
      chemotherapy for his PMNSGCT was restarted. He received surgery after the fourth 
      cycle of BEP without recurrence of COVID-19. Chemotherapy could be restarted and 
      followed by surgery in this post-COVID-19 patient who had experienced mild 
      illness after the discharge criteria were met and all symptoms had disappeared. 
      We report this case with a review of the literature on restarting chemotherapy 
      after SARS-CoV2 infection.

AB  - Recent investigations have demonstrated a relationship between the persistence of 
      SARS-CoV-2 and post-COVID-19 conditions. Building upon a potential connection 
      between SARS-CoV-2 persistence and early virologic rebound, we examine the 
      association of early virologic rebound with post-acute mortality and 
      hospitalization due to post-acute sequelae among hospitalized patients with 
      COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Our study includes 13,859, 3959, and 4502 patients in the 
      all-patient, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, and molnupiravir group, respectively. 
      Results show that patients who experienced virologic rebound exhibited a 
      significantly higher risk of post-acute mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.52; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.36-1.70) with a risk difference [RD] of 7.19%, 
      compared with patients without virologic rebound. A similar increase in the risk 
      of post-acute mortality is also observed in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-treated 
      patients (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.41-2.25; RD, 12.55%) and molnupiravir-treated 
      patients (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.18-1.82; RD, 4.90%). The virologic rebound may thus 
      serve as an early marker for post-COVID-19 condition, enabling healthcare 
      officials to monitor and provide timely intervention for long COVID.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) condition, known as "post-COVID 
      syndrome," is associated with a range of complications persisting even after 
      recovery. Among these complications, cognitive dysfunction, including memory 
      impairment, has been relatively common observed, impacting executive function and 
      quality of life. To date, no approved treatment exists for this specific 
      complication. Therefore, the present clinical trial aimed to investigate the 
      impact of Donepezil Hydrochloride on post-COVID memory impairment. METHODS: A 
      randomized, controlled trial (Approval ID: IRCT20210816052203N1) was conducted, 
      enrolling 25 patients with post-COVID memory impairment. Participants with a 
      history of hospitalization were randomly assigned to either the drug group 
      (n = 10) or the control group (n = 15). Memory indices were assessed at baseline, 
      one month, and three months later using the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised test. 
      SPSS software and appropriate statistical tests were employed for data analysis. 
      RESULTS: The statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in WMS-R 
      subtest and index scores between the drug and control groups at the 4-week and 
      12-week follow-up periods. However, within the drug group, there was a notable 
      increase in the visual reproduction I and verbal paired associates II subtests 
      during the specified time intervals. CONCLUSION: While donepezil 5 mg did not 
      exhibit a significant overall increase in memory scales compared to the control 
      group over time, our findings suggest that this medication may exert a positive 
      effect on specific memory subtests. Further research and exploration are 
      warranted to better understand the potential benefits of donepezil in managing 
      post-COVID-related memory impairment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved 
      by the Research Ethics Committee of Aja University of Medical Sciences (Approval 
      ID: IR.AJAUMS.REC.1400.125) and registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical 
      Trials (IRCT) (Approval ID: IRCT20210816052203N1).

TI  - The impact of early therapies for COVID-19 on death, hospitalization and 
      persisting symptoms: a retrospective study.
PG  - 1633-1644

AB  - PURPOSE: Oral antivirals (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir), intravenous 
      short treatment of remdesivir and anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
      have been used for early COVID-19 treatments in high risk of disease progression 
      patients. The term long COVID has been used to refer to a range of new, 
      returning, or ongoing symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Little is known about 
      the impact of such therapies on long COVID. METHODS: This is a retrospective 
      observational study, including all outpatients evaluated from April 2021 to March 
      2022 in Brescia, Lombardy, northern Italy. Patients were stratified in three 
      groups: (a) treated with mAbs, (b) treated with antivirals drugs and (c) controls 
      (patients eligible for a or b who refused treatment). Data were collected at 
      baseline and at month 1 and 3 (data on self-reported symptoms were collected 
      using a telephone-administered questionnaire). We assessed early COVID-19 
      therapies effectiveness in preventing hospitalization, death at 1 or 3 months and 
      persisting symptoms at 3 months after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: 
      A total of 649 patients were included in the study, of which 242 (37.3%) were 
      treated with mAbs, 197 (30.3%) with antiviral drugs and 210 (32.4%) were not 
      treated. Patients most frequently reported cerebro-cardiovascular diseases 
      (36.7%) followed by obesity (22%). Overall, 29 patients (4.5%) died or were 
      hospitalized at 1 or 3-month follow-up. Death or hospitalization was positively 
      associated with older ages, with a significant linear trend (OR 3.05; 95% CI 
      1.16-8.06, for patients aged 80 or more years compared to those aged less than 
      65). Data on long COVID at 3 months were available for 323 (49.8%) patients. A 
      positive association emerged for females compared to men, with an OR of 2.14 (95% 
      CI 1.30-3.53) for any symptoms. Conversely, inverse associations were found for 
      treatment groups as compared to the control one, with significant estimates among 
      patients treated with antiviral drugs for any symptoms (OR 0.43, 95% CI 
      0.21-0.87) and patients treated with mAbs for any neuro-behavioral symptoms (OR 
      0.48, 95% CI 0.25-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: We report beneficial effect of early use of 
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 antivirals and mAbs on long COVID.

AB  - This paper suggests that ATP release induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a key 
      role in the genesis of the major symptoms and complications of COVID-19. 
      Infection of specific cells which contain the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 
      (ACE2) receptor results in a loss of protection of the Mineralocorticoid Receptor 
      (MR). Local activation by cortisol stimulates the release of ATP initially into 
      the basolateral compartment and then by lysosomal exocytosis from the cell 
      surface. This then acts on adjacent cells. In the nose ATP acts as a nociceptive 
      stimulus which results in anosmia. It is suggested that a similar paracrine 
      mechanism is responsible for the loss of taste. In the lung ATP release from type 
      2 alveolar cells produces the non-productive cough by acting on purinergic 
      receptors on adjacent neuroepithelial cells and activating, via the vagus, the 
      cough reflex. Infection of endothelial cells results in the exocytosis of 
      WeibelPalade bodies. These contain the Von Willebrand Factor responsible for 
      micro-clotting and angiopoietin-2 which increases vascular permeability and plays 
      a key role in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. To test this hypothesis 
      this paper reports proof of concept studies in which MR blockade using 
      spironolactone and low dose dexamethasone (SpiDex) was given to PCR-confirmed 
      COVID-19 patients. In 80 patients with moderate to severe respiratory failure 40 
      were given SpiDex and 40 conventional treatment with high dose dexamethasone 
      (HiDex). There was 1 death in the HiDex group and none in the SpiDex. As judged 
      by clinical, biochemical and radiological parameters there were clear 
      statistically significant benefits of SpiDex in comparison to HiDex. A further 20 
      outpatients with COVID-19 were given SpiDex. There was no control group and the 
      aim was to demonstrate safety. No adverse effects were noted and no patient 
      became hyperkalaemic. 90% were asymptomatic at 10 days. The very positive results 
      suggest that blockade of the MR can produce major benefit in COVID19 patients. 
      Further larger controlled studies of inpatients and outpatients are required not 
      only for SARS-CoV-2 infection per se but also to determine if this treatment 
      affects the incidence of Long COVID.

TI  - Computational Prediction of the Interaction of Ivermectin with Fibrinogen.
LID - 10.3390/ijms241411449 [doi]
LID - 11449
AB  - Hypercoagulability and formation of extensive and difficult-to-lyse microclots 
      are a hallmark of both acute COVID-19 and long COVID. Fibrinogen, when converted 
      to fibrin, is responsible for clot formation, but abnormal structural and 
      mechanical clot properties can lead to pathologic thrombosis. Recent experimental 
      evidence suggests that the spike protein (SP) from severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may directly bind to the blood coagulation 
      factor fibrinogen and induce structurally abnormal blood clots with heightened 
      proinflammatory activity. Accordingly, in this study, we used molecular docking 
      and molecular dynamics simulations to explore the potential activity of the 
      antiparasitic drug ivermectin (IVM) to prevent the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 SP 
      to fibrinogen and reduce the occurrence of microclots. Our computational results 
      indicate that IVM may bind with high affinity to multiple sites on the fibrinogen 
      peptide, with binding more likely in the central, E region, and in the 
      coiled-coil region, as opposed to the globular D region. Taken together, our in 
      silico results suggest that IVM may interfere with SP-fibrinogen binding and, 
      potentially, decrease the formation of fibrin clots resistant to degradation. 
      Additional in vitro studies are warranted to validate whether IVM binding to 
      fibrinogen is sufficiently stable to prevent interaction with the SP, and 
      potentially reduce its thrombo-inflammatory effect in vivo.

      Inflammation-Driven Downregulation of Metabolism as a Potential Mechanism.

LID - 10269
AB  - Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 
      disease compared to the general population. This is partly driven by their use of 
      immunosuppressive therapy, which influences inflammatory responses and viral 
      loads. Current guidelines suggest to withdraw mycophenolate while calcineurin 
      inhibitors are often continued during a COVID-19 infection. However, clinical 
      signs of calcineurin toxicity have been described in multiple COVID-19 positive 
      KTRs. In this report we describe the course of tacrolimus exposure prior to, 
      during, and post COVID-19 in observations from three clinical cases as well as 
      four KTRs from a controlled trial population. We postulate inflammation driven 
      downregulation of the CYP3A metabolism as a potential mechanism for higher 
      tacrolimus exposure. To mitigate the risk of tacrolimus overexposure and toxicity 
      therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended in KTRs with COVID-19 both in the in-, 
      out-patient and home monitoring setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been frequently demonstrated to be associated with 
      anosmia. Calcium cations are a mainstay in the transmission of odor. One of their 
      documented effects is feedback inhibition. Thus, it has been advocated that 
      reducing the free intranasal calcium cations using topical chelators such as 
      pentasodium diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA) could lead to restoration of 
      the olfactory function in patients with post-COVID-19 anosmia. METHODOLOGY: This 
      is a randomized controlled trial that investigated the effect of DTPA on 
      post-COVID-19 anosmia. A total of 66 adult patients who had confirmed COVID-19 
      with associated anosmia that continued beyond three months of being negative for 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. The included patients were randomly allocated to the 
      control group that received 0.9 % sodium chloride-containing nasal spray or the 
      interventional group that received 2 % DTPA-containing nasal spray at a 1:1 
      ratio. Before treatment and 30 days post-treatment, the patients' olfactory 
      function was evaluated using Sniffin' Sticks, and quantitative estimation of the 
      calcium cations in the nasal mucus was done using a carbon paste ion-selective 
      electrode test. RESULTS: Patients in the DTPA-treated group significantly 
      improved compared to the control group in recovery from functional anosmia to 
      hyposmia. Additionally, they showed a significant post-treatment reduction in the 
      calcium concentration compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: This study 
      confirmed the efficacy of DTPA in treating post-COVID-19 anosmia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over 65 million people have long COVID. Evidence for using Chinese 
      herbal medicine (CHM) to treat long COVID is growing. A systematic review of 
      evidence for guiding clinical decision is warranted. OBJECTIVE: To examine the 
      effects and safety of CHM in alleviating the severity of dyspnea, fatigue, 
      exercise intolerance, depression, anxiety and insomnia in long COVID adults based 
      on registered randomized clinical trials (RCT). SEARCH STRATEGY: World Health 
      Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and Chinese Clinical 
      Trial Registry were searched for registered trial protocols from database 
      inception to February 10, 2023. English (PubMed, Embase, AMED and CINAHL) and 
      Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang Data and CQVIP) were then searched to identify 
      relevant publications from December 2019 through April 6, 2023. INCLUSION 
      CRITERIA: Registered RCTs that compared the effects of Chinese herbal medicines 
      or Chinese herbal formulas against a control treatment (i.e., the placebo or 
      usual care) in adults with persistent symptoms of long COVID. The primary outcome 
      of dyspnea, and secondary outcomes of fatigue, exercise intolerance, depression, 
      anxiety and insomnia were measured using validated tools at the end of the 
      treatment. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted, and eligible RCTs 
      were evaluated using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized 
      trials and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations 
      independently by two researchers. Effect sizes were estimated by random-effects 
      modelling and mean difference (MD). Heterogeneity between trials was quantified 
      by I(2). RESULTS: Among the 38 registered clinical trials we identified, seven 
      RCTs (1,519 patients) were included in the systematic review. One RCT had a low 
      overall risk of bias. Compared to the control, CHM reduces dyspnea on the Borg 
      Dyspnea Scale score (MD = -0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.65 to 0.25) 
      with moderate certainty, and reduces fatigue on the Borg Scale (MD = -0.48, 95% 
      CI = -0.74 to -0.22) with low certainty. CHM clinically reduces depression on 
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score (MD = -6.00, 95% CI = -7.56 to -4.44) and 
      anxiety on Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score (MD = -6.10, 95% CI = -7.67 to 
      -4.53), and reduces insomnia on the Insomnia Severity Index (MD = -4.86, 95% 
      CI = -12.50 to 2.79) with moderate certainty. Meta-analysis of two RCTs (517 
      patients) showed that CHM clinically improves exercise intolerance by increasing 
      6-minute walking distance (MD = -15.92, 95% CI = -10.20 to 42.05) with 
      substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 68%) and low certainty. CONCLUSION: CHM is 
      associated with a post-treatment clinical reduction in depression and anxiety in 
      long COVID adults, compared to the control, but it does not have a strong 
      treatment effect on dyspnea and insomnia. Effects of CHM on exercise intolerance 
      and fatigue are uncertain, and the safety of using CHM remains questionable.

AB  - The COVID-19 epidemic in recent years has been produced by various coronavirus 
      strains that nearly destroyed world health policies and economics. Emerging viral 
      strains exacerbated the pandemic. Huge investments have been made in preventative 
      vaccines to combat the disease, but the genetic instability of these viruses has 
      hampered their usefulness. However, in addition to traditional therapeutic 
      approaches, nutraceuticals have been considered efficacious in preventing and or 
      treating COVID-19 and post-COVID syndrome. In this context, nutraceuticals such 
      as vitamins or dietary supplements including multiple vitamins and minerals and 
      propolis have been widely studied for their significant impact on viral 
      respiratory diseases like SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Some of these nutraceuticals 
      having antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and immune-modulatory properties have been 
      highly recommended for use as an adjunct option to moderate the adverse effects 
      associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we intend to present the 
      recent understanding and converse scientific implications for the use of 
      nutraceutical antioxidants such as vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and 
      polyphenols like bee propolis, in the management of viral respiratory diseases 
      and post-COVID-19 syndrome. Future challenges and limitations regarding the use 
      and bioavailability of these ingredients, and dose-response studies are further 
      emphasized.

TI  - Vortioxetine for Cognitive Impairment in Major Depressive Disorder During 
      Post-COVID Syndrome: Real-World Evidence.
LID - 24m15387 [pii]
LID - 10.4088/JCP.24m15387 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To compare the effectiveness of vortioxetine versus escitalopram and 
      sertraline as a treatment in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 
      post-COVID syndrome (PCS). Methods: This is a prospective, open-label, 
      comparative effectiveness study in individuals with new-onset MDD as PCS outcome. 
      The study was carried out in 1 clinical site. Individuals who had a history of 
      confirmed SARS-CoV 2 infection, who met World Health Organization-defined 
      criteria for PCS, and who met new-onset of MDD criteria according to DSM-5-TR 
      were included. Participants that were eligible were assigned to receive 
      vortioxetine at 10-20 mg/d, escitalopram 10-20 mg/d, or sertraline 50-200 mg/d 
      over 8 weeks. The primary and secondary outcomes were changes from baseline to 
      end point in Digital Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and Montgomery-Asberg 
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) or Patient Reported Outcome Measurement 
      Information System Fatigue Short Form 7a (PROMIS 7a), respectively. Data were 
      collected during January 2022 and December 2023. Results: 140 participants were 
      assigned to received vortioxetine (n = 70), escitalopram (n = 36), or sertraline 
      (n = 34). Participants assigned to vortioxetine exhibited significant changes in 
      DSST scores from baseline to end point compared to escitalopram or sertraline 
      (least squares [LS] mean differences, 8.25; 95% CI, 6.25-10.25; P < .001; LS mean 
      differences, 8.00; 95% CI, 5.95-10.06; P < .001, respectively). Participants in 
      the vortioxetine treatment group reported significantly greater changes in total 
      MADRS scores from baseline to end point compared to escitalopram or sertraline 
      (LS mean differences, -4.06; 95% CI, -4.92 to -3.20; P < .001; LS mean 
      differences, -3.94; 95% CI, -4.83 to -3.06; P < .001, respectively). Conclusion: 
      Vortioxetine has a significant procognitive effect. Antidepressant effects and 
      improvement in fatigue symptoms (PROMIS 7a) also were observed.

AB  - We describe the case of a 17-year-old woman diagnosed with complex regional pain 
      syndrome (CRPS) at a pain clinic after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. 
      She was referred to our department for surgical treatment of movement disorder 
      seven months after the second inoculation. Baclofen (50 µg), administered 
      intrathecally, improved the involuntary movements of her right hand. After 
      administration of zolpidem (5 mg), involuntary movements of the right index 
      finger almost disappeared. However, neither zolpidem nor intrathecal baclofen 
      improved the limited range of motion of the first joint of the left-hand finger. 
      Despite various reports on CRPS development after vaccination, only one case post 
      COVID-19 vaccination has been reported. Therefore, healthcare providers should 
      keep in mind that CRPS can appear after the COVID-19 vaccination.

TI  - Current Insights on the Photoprotective Mechanism of the Macular Carotenoids, 
      Lutein and Zeaxanthin: Safety, Efficacy and Bio-Delivery.
PG  - 505-518
LID - 10.1080/27697061.2024.2319090 [doi]
AB  - Ocular health has emerged as one of the major issues of global health concern 
      with a decline in quality of life in an aging population, in particular and rise 
      in the number of associated morbidities and mortalities. One of the chief reasons 
      for vision impairment is oxidative damage inflicted to photoreceptors in rods and 
      cone cells by blue light as well as UV radiation. The scenario has been 
      aggravated by unprecedented rise in screen-time during the COVID and post-COVID 
      era. Lutein and Zeaxanthin are oxygenated carotenoids with proven roles in 
      augmentation of ocular health largely by virtue of their antioxidant properties 
      and protective effects against photobleaching of retinal pigments, age-linked 
      macular degeneration, cataract, and retinitis pigmentosa. These molecules are 
      characterized by their characteristic yellow-orange colored pigmentation and are 
      found in significant amounts in vegetables such as corn, spinach, broccoli, 
      carrots as well as fish and eggs. Unique structural signatures including 
      tetraterpenoid skeleton with extensive conjugation and the presence of hydroxyl 
      groups at the end rings have made these molecules evolutionarily adapted to 
      localize in the membrane of the photoreceptor cells and prevent their free 
      radical induced peroxidation. Apart from the benefits imparted to ocular health, 
      lutein and zeaxanthin are also known to improve cognitive function, 
      cardiovascular physiology, and arrest the development of malignancy. Although 
      abundant in many natural sources, bioavailability of these compounds is low owing 
      to their long aliphatic backbones. Under the circumstances, there has been a 
      concerted effort to develop vegetable oil-based carriers such as lipid 
      nano-emulsions for therapeutic administration of carotenoids. This review 
      presents a comprehensive update of the therapeutic potential of the carotenoids 
      along with the challenges in achieving an optimized delivery tool for maximizing 
      their effectiveness inside the body.

OAB - Lutein and zeaxanthin are the two most abundant natural xanthophylls (oxygenated 
      carotenoids) with a linear C40 tetraterpene/isoprenoid lycopene-based 
      backbone.Presence of extensive conjugation (more than 10 double bonds) enable 
      these molecules to act as accessory light harvesting pigments apart from 
      chlorophyll.More importantly, the xanthophylls prevent photobleaching of the 
      pigments and proteins in the Light Harvesting Complex (LHC) by sequestering the 
      excess unutilized blue light and preventing triplet chlorophyll associated 
      formation of Reactive Oxygen Species.In human eye, lutein, zeaxanthin along with 
      mesozeaxanthin constitute the three macular pigments forming the so called 
      “yellow spot” of the macula and are implicated in maintaining the redox balance, 
      homeostasis and normal physiology of the eyes.However, unlike plants, 
      xanthophylls must be acquired from dietary sources such as colored leafy 
      vegetables and egg yolk.Increase in the number of eye diseases in the aging 
      population coupled with insufficient bioavailability of xanthophylls has mandated 
      the industrial production of supplements enriched in xanthophylls.The 
      bioavailability and delivery of xanthophylls can be significantly enhanced by 
      suspension in a blend of extra-virgin olive oil and other vegetable oils.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the rapid production of vaccines aimed at the 
      production of neutralizing antibodies against the COVID-19 spike protein required 
      for the corona virus binding to target cells. The best well-known vaccines have 
      utilized either mRNA or an adenovirus vector to direct human cells to produce the 
      spike protein against which the body produces mostly neutralizing antibodies. 
      However, recent reports have raised some skepticism as to the biologic actions of 
      the spike protein and the types of antibodies produced. One paper reported that 
      certain antibodies in the blood of infected patients appear to change the shape 
      of the spike protein so as to make it more likely to bind to cells, while other 
      papers showed that the spike protein by itself (without being part of the corona 
      virus) can damage endothelial cells and disrupt the blood-brain barrier. These 
      findings may be even more relevant to the pathogenesis of long-COVID syndrome 
      that may affect as many as 50% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2. In COVID-19, a 
      response to oxidative stress is required by increasing anti-oxidant enzymes. In 
      this regard, it is known that polyphenols are natural anti-oxidants with multiple 
      health effects. Hence, there are even more reasons to intervene with the use of 
      anti-oxidant compounds, such as luteolin, in addition to available vaccines and 
      anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent the harmful actions of the spike protein.

TI  - [NATURAL THERAPEUTIC FACTORS IN MEDICAL REHABILITATION OF PATIENTS WITH 
      POST-COVID-19 AT OUTPATIENT TREATMENT STAGE].
PG  - 110-114
AB  - The purpose of the research is to study therapeutic efficiency of medical 
      rehabilitation of patients with Post-COVID-19 syndrome at outpatient treatment 
      stage including natural therapeutic factors and phyto products in rehabilitation 
      programme. In Nalchik resort 64 patients suffering from corona virus disease 
      COVID-19 have been examined. They were distributed into 2 groups. 30 patients of 
      the group of comparison were prescribed mineral water «Nalchik», exercise 
      therapy, foam cocktails and rectal suppositories with thick licorice root 
      extract. 34 patients of the main group additionally had natural aeroionophyto 
      therapy along the route of mid-mountain natural park of Nalchik resort in 
      combination with exercise therapy and group psychotherapy in park curative 
      grounds and nitrogen thermal baths. The effectiveness was assessed with the help 
      of the scale «Medical Research Council» (mMRC), the level of glycyrrhic acid in 
      blood serum, functional tests, cardiointervalography in dynamics. The conducted 
      comparative analysis proved the ability of natural therapeutic factors to 
      influence the main life-supporting body systems positively. Therefore, the 
      patients of the main group had a reduction of apnea by 29,4% (p<0,01) in 
      comparison with the primary data, increase in adaptation capacity, on average, by 
      42,4% (p<0,01), improvement of physical activity, on average, by 36,2% (p<0,01), 
      normalization of hemodynamic parameters. It was significantly better (by 20-25%, 
      p<0,05) compared to the treatment in the group of comparison. There has been 
      developed a new method of medical rehabilitation of patients with Post-COVID-19 
      syndrome at outpatient treatment stage including phytotherapy with licorice root 
      extract and natural aeroionophyto therapy, exercise therapy, psychotherapy along 
      the route of mid-mountain natural park in Nalchik resort, which significantly 
      promotes (p<0,05) optimization of rehabilitation activities.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic struck in the midst of an ongoing opioid epidemic. To 
      offset disruption to life-saving treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), several 
      federal agencies granted exemptions to existing federal regulations. This 
      included loosening restrictions on medications for OUD (MOUD), including 
      methadone and buprenorphine. In this commentary, we briefly review policy and 
      practice guidelines for treating OUD prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      We then outline specific MOUD treatment policy and practice exemptions that went 
      into effect in February and March 2020, and discuss the ways in which these 
      unprecedented changes have dramatically changed MOUD treatment. Given the 
      unprecedented nature of these changes, and unknown outcomes to date, we advocate 
      for a data-driven approach to guide future policy and practice recommendations 
      regarding MOUD. We outline several critical clinical, research, and policy 
      questions that can inform MOUD treatment in a post-COVID-19 era.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is currently no consensus on the diagnosis, definition, 
      symptoms, or duration of COVID-19 illness. The diagnostic complexity of Long 
      COVID is compounded in many patients who were or might have been infected with 
      SARS-CoV-2 but not tested during the acute illness and/or are SARS-CoV-2 antibody 
      negative. METHODS: Given the diagnostic conundrum of Long COVID, we set out to 
      investigate SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in patients with confirmed 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or Long COVID from a cohort of mostly non-hospitalised 
      patients. FINDINGS: We discovered that IL-2 release (but not IFN-γ release) from 
      T cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptides is both sensitive (75% +/-13%) and 
      specific (88%+/-7%) for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection >6 months after a positive 
      PCR test. We identified that 42-53% of patients with Long COVID, but without 
      detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, nonetheless have detectable SARS-CoV-2 specific 
      T cell responses. INTERPRETATION: Our study reveals evidence (detectable T cell 
      mediated IL-2 release) of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in seronegative patients 
      with Long COVID. FUNDING: This work was funded by the Addenbrooke's Charitable 
      Trust (900276 to NS), NIHR award (G112259 to NS) and supported by the NIHR 
      Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre. NJM is supported by the MRC (TSF

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on preventing post-COVID 
      condition (PCC) in the BA4, BA5, and XBB Omicron predominant periods is not well 
      understood. The purpose of this study was to assess how nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
      treatment affected both PCC and health-related quality of life. METHODS: This 
      retrospective cohort study enrolled 2,524 adults aged 18 years and older who were 
      eligible for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir between July 14 to November 14, 2022. All 
      outcomes were observed from the patient's first visit to the primary health 
      clinic, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after testing positive for 
      COVID-19. The primary outcome was the presence of PCC. Secondary outcomes 
      included the effects on health-related quality of life, such as walking, bathing 
      and dressing, activities, cause adverse emotions or signs that prevent 
      individuals from leading normal lives over a 180-day observation period. RESULTS: 
      There were no significant differences observed between the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
      and those not administered (control group) in terms of PCC symptoms at 3 months 
      (OR 0.71 95% CI 0.31, 1.64) and 6 months (OR 1.30 95% CI 0.76, 2.21). At 3 
      months, the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was associated with a 26% reduction in 
      symptoms causing negative emotions (OR 0.74 95% CI 0.60, 0.92) and an increased 
      likelihood of symptoms limiting walking (OR 1.58 95% CI 1.10, 2.27). However, 
      there were no significant differences between the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and the 
      control group in terms of the impact of PCC on health-related quality of life at 
      6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the administration of 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir does not significantly reduce PCC after 3 months and 6 
      months in a population with high vaccination coverage.

LID - e039480
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultrasound enhancing agents (UEAs) are an important diagnostic tool 
      for transthoracic or stress echocardiography (TTE/SE) but recent concerns have 
      been raised about their safety in reports from individual health systems. As 
      such, we aimed to identify if UEAs for TTE/SE are associated with serious adverse 
      events within 2 days of administration. METHODS AND RESULTS: All-payor nationwide 
      claims from 11.4 million insured individuals across the United States, 2018 to 
      2022 were used to evaluate rates of death, anaphylaxis, myocardial infarction, 
      ventricular tachycardia, or cardiac arrest within 2 days of TTE/SE among adults 
      receiving and not receiving UEAs. Of the 11 421 463 individuals included (mean 
      age 57.5±16.2, 54.0% female, 46.2% White), a total of 500 073 (4.4%) received 
      TTE/SE with UEAs. After propensity score matching, the odds of death were lower 
      in those receiving UEAs (receipt versus nonreceipt, 0.02% versus 0.14%, odds 
      ratio [OR], 0.23 [95% CI, 0.19-0.28], P<0.001) and were not different across 
      agents (Definity: 0.02%, OR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.18-0.28]; Lumason: 0.03%, OR, 0.33 
      [95% CI, 0.20-0.57]; Optison: 0.01%, OR, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.08-0.38]; all 
      P < 0.001). Rates of nondeath outcomes were similar to those observed in 
      individuals not receiving UEAs, overall, and across specific agents. Rates of all 
      outcomes were stable across years, including considering pre- and post-COVID 
      periods. CONCLUSIONS: In this large nationwide claims analysis from 2018 to 2022, 
      serious adverse events associated with UEAs for TTE/SE were uncommon and overall 
      consistent across agents and years of study. Compared with nonreceipt, receipt of 
      UEAs was associated with a lower odds of death within 2 days of TTE/SE.

AB  - One-fifth of COVID-19 patients suffer a severe course of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infection; however, the specific causes remain unclear. Despite numerous papers 
      that have been flooded in different scientific journals clear clinical picture of 
      COVID-19 aftermath persists to remain fuzzy. The survivors of severe 
      COVID-19infection having defeated the virus are just the starting of an uncharted 
      recovery path. Currently, there is no drug available that is safe to consume to 
      combat this pandemic. However, researchers still struggling to find specific 
      therapeutic solutions. The present study employed an in silico approach to 
      assessing the inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals obtained from GC-MS 
      analysis of Citrus macroptera against inflammatory proteins like COX-2, NMDAR and 
      VCAM-1 which remains in a hyperactive state even after a patient is fully cured 
      of this deadly mRNA virus. An extensive molecular docking investigation of the 
      phyto-compounds at the active binding pockets of the inflammatory proteins 
      revealed the promising inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals. Reasonable 
      physicochemical attributes of the compounds following Lipinski's rule of five, 
      VEBER and PAINS analysis further established them as potential therapeutic 
      candidates against aforesaid inflammatory proteins. MM-GBSA binding free energy 
      estimation revealed that Limonene was the most promising candidate displaying the 
      highest binding efficacy with the concerned VCAM-1 protein included in the 
      present analysis. An interesting finding is the phytochemicals exhibited better 
      binding energy scores with the concerned COX-2, VCAM-1 and NMDA receptor proteins 
      than the conventional drugs that are specifically targeted against them. Our in 
      silico results suggest that all the natural phyto-compounds derived from C. 
      macroptera could be employed in Post covid inflammation complexities after 
      appropriate pre-clinical and clinical trials for further scientific 
      validation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - Oxidative stress (OS) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and may 
      be associated with sequelae after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study 
      evaluated OS and inflammation biomarkers in blood from individuals with 
      post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). 64 male and female participants were 
      distributed into three groups: healthy individuals (n = 20), acute COVID-19 
      patients (symptoms for <3 weeks, n = 15), and PASC patients (symptoms for >12 
      weeks, n = 29). Analyses included inflammatory cytokines, myeloperoxidase (MPO) 
      activity, and OS markers, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), 
      glutathione S-transferase (GST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), reduced 
      glutathione (GSH), uric acid (UA), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances 
      (TBARS), and protein carbonyls (PC). Individuals with PASC showed increased IL-6 
      and IL-8. Both COVID-19 groups exhibited decreased SOD and CAT. GST decreased 
      only in the acute group. Elevated GGT and GSH were found in the PASC group. High 
      UA levels were observed in PASC individuals. There were no changes in TBARS 
      values ⁣⁣in the PASC group. However, PC concentrations were elevated only in this 
      group. Correlations were identified between inflammatory markers and OS 
      parameters. These findings suggest that individuals with PASC pronounced OS, 
      which potentially exacerbates disease complications. Monitoring OS biomarkers 
      could aid in patient prognosis and management.

TI  - Alleviation of Post-COVID-19 Cognitive Deficits by Treatment with EGb 761®: A 
      Case Series.
PG  - e937094
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.937094 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Cognitive symptoms persisting longer than 3 months after infection, 
      such as memory loss, or difficulties concentrating, have been reported in up to 
      one-third of patients after COVID-19. Evidence-based therapeutic interventions to 
      treat post-COVID-19 symptoms (also called "Long-COVID symptoms") have not yet 
      been established, and the treating physicians must rely on conjecture to help 
      patients. Based on its mechanism of action and its efficacy in treating cognitive 
      impairment, as well as its good tolerability, the Ginkgo biloba special extract 
      EGb 761 has been suggested as a remedy to alleviate cognitive post-COVID-19 
      symptoms. In many studies, EGb 761 has been demonstrated to protect endothelial 
      cells, to have potent anti-inflammatory effects, and to enhance neuroplasticity. 
      CASE REPORT Here, we report for the first time the application of EGb 761 in the 
      therapy of post-COVID-19-related cognitive deficits. Three women and 2 men, aged 
      26 to 59 years (average age 34.6 years), presented with concentration and 
      attention deficits, cognitive deficiencies, and/or fatigue 9-35 weeks after 
      infection. A daily dose of 2×80 mg of EGb 761 did not cause any detectable 
      adverse effects, and it substantially improved or completely restored cognitive 
      deficits and, when initially present, also other symptoms, such as fatigue and 
      hyposmia, within an observation period of up to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS Our 
      observations support the hypothesis that EGb 761 might be a low-risk treatment

TI  - Preventive effects of Pycnogenol® on cardiovascular risk factors (including 
      endothelial function) and microcirculation in subjects recovering from 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
PG  - 300-308
LID - 10.23736/S0026-4806.21.07650-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this open supplement study was to evaluate the effects of 
      Pycnogenol(®) in comparison with controls on symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome 
      and in improving endothelial function, microcirculation, inflammatory markers and 
      oxidative stress over 3 months in symptomatic subjects recovering from COVID-19. 
      METHODS: Sixty subjects recovering from symptomatic COVID-19 were included. One 
      group of 30 followed a standard recovery management while 30 comparable subjects 
      received a supplement of 150 mg Pycnogenol(®) daily (in 3 doses of 50 mg) in 
      addition to standard management. RESULTS: Two groups of selected subjects were 
      comparable at baseline. The groups progressively improved both with the SM 
      (standard management) and with the SM in combination with the supplement. 
      Patients, supplemented with Pycnogenol(®) showed significantly better improvement 
      compared to the control group patients. No side effects from the supplementation 
      were observed; tolerability was optimal. The progressive evolution over time was 
      visible in all target measurements. Physiological tests: endothelial function, 
      low in all subjects at inclusion was assessed by flow mediated dilation (FMD) and 
      finger reactive hyperemia in the microcirculation (laser Doppler measurements) 
      after the release of an occluding suprasystolic cuff. It was significantly 
      improved in the Pycnogenol(®) group after one month and after 3 months (P<0.05 
      vs. controls). The rate of ankle swelling (RAS) by strain gauge decreased 
      significantly in the supplemented group (P<0.05) in comparison with controls 
      showing an improvement of the capillary filtration rate. At inclusion, the kidney 
      cortical flow velocity indicated a decrease in perfusion (lower systolic and 
      diastolic flow velocity) in all patients. Kidney cortical flow velocity increased 
      significantly with the supplement (P<0.05) in comparison with controls with 
      improvement in systolic velocity and in diastolic component. High sensitivity CRP 
      (hs-CRP) and Il-6 plasma levels decreased progressively over 3 months with a 
      significant more pronounced decrease in the supplement group (P<0.05). The number 
      of patients with normal plasma IL-6 levels at the end of the study was higher 
      (P<0.05) with the supplement. ESR followed the same pattern with a progressive 
      and a more significant decrease in the supplemented subjects (P<0.02). Oxidative 
      stress decreased significantly in the supplemented group (P<0.05) compared with 
      the control group. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the 
      supplemented group (P<0.05) at the end of the study. Finally, the scores of 
      Quality-of-life, mood and fatigue questionnaire and the Karnofsky Scale 
      Performance Index significantly improved in the supplement group (P<0.05) 
      compared to controls after 1 and 3 months. All other blood parameters (including 
      platelets and clotting factors) were within normal values at the end of the 
      study. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, Pycnogenol(®) may offer a significant option 
      for managing some of the signs and symptoms associated with post-COVID-19 
      syndrome. This pilot evaluation offers some potential rationale for the use of 
      Pycnogenol(®) in this condition that will have significant importance in the 
      coming years.

AB  - Symptom treatments for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and Long 
      COVID are one of the most critical issues of the pandemic era. In light of the 
      lack of standardized medications for treating COVID-19 symptoms, traditional 
      Chinese medicine (TCM) has emerged as a potentially viable strategy based on 
      numerous studies and clinical manifestations. Taiwan Chingguan Yihau (NRICM101), 
      a TCM designed based on a medicinal formula with a long history of almost 500 
      years, has demonstrated its antiviral properties through clinical studies, yet 
      the pharmacogenomic knowledge for this formula remains unclear. The molecular 
      mechanism of NRICM101 was systematically analyzed by using exploratory 
      bioinformatics and pharmacodynamics (PD) approaches. Results showed that there 
      were 434 common interactions found between NRICM101 and COVID-19 related 
      genes/proteins. For the network pharmacology of the NRICM101, the 434 common 
      interacting genes/proteins had the highest associations with the interleukin 
      (IL)-17 signaling pathway in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
      analyses. Moreover, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was found to have the highest 
      association with the 30 most frequently curated NRICM101 chemicals. Disease 
      analyses also revealed that the most relevant diseases with COVID-19 infections 
      were pathology, followed by cancer, digestive system disease, and cardiovascular 
      disease. The 30 most frequently curated human genes and 2 microRNAs identified in 
      this study could also be used as molecular biomarkers or therapeutic options for 
      COVID-19 treatments. In addition, dose-response profiles of NRICM101 doses and 
      IL-6 or TNF-α expressions in cell cultures of murine alveolar macrophages were 
      constructed to provide pharmacodynamic (PD) information of NRICM101. The 
      prevalent use of NRICM101 for standardized treatments to attenuate common 
      residual syndromes or chronic sequelae of COVID-19 were also revealed for 
      post-pandemic future.

      long COVID.
PG  - e29089
LID - 10.1002/jmv.29089 [doi]
AB  - Long COVID (LC) is an emerging global health concern. The underlying mechanism 
      and pathophysiology remain unclear. Presence of neutralizing autoantibodies 
      against type 1 interferons (IFN) has been established as a predictor of critical 
      COVID-19. We hypothesized that persistent autoimmune activity with autoantibodies 
      against type 1 IFN may contribute to symptoms in patients with LC. Plasma samples 
      and clinical information were obtained from a Danish LC cohort consisting of 
      adult patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Information on symptoms and quality of life was derived 
      from an LC-specific questionnaire and the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Detection of 
      type 1 IFN autoantibodies in plasma were performed by ELISA. Samples collected 
      between June, 2020, and September, 2021, from 279 patients were analyzed and 
      compared to a control group of 94 individuals with prior mild SARS-CoV-2 
      infection who did not develop LC symptoms. In total, five LC patients (1.8%) and 
      3 (3.2%) of the controls had detectable circulating type 1 IFN autoantibodies. 
      Collectively, prevalence of autoantibodies against type 1 IFN subtypes in our LC 
      cohort were primarily driven by men and did not exceed the prevalence in 
      controls. Thus, in our cohort, anti-type I IFN autoantibodies are unlikely to 
      drive LC symptoms.

TI  - In Silico Screening of Natural Flavonoids against 3-Chymotrypsin-like Protease of 
      SARS-CoV-2 Using Machine Learning and Molecular Modeling.

AB  - The "Long-COVID syndrome" has posed significant challenges due to a lack of 
      validated therapeutic options. We developed a novel multi-step virtual screening 
      strategy to reliably identify inhibitors against 3-chymotrypsin-like protease of 
      SARS-CoV-2 from abundant flavonoids, which represents a promising source of 
      antiviral and immune-boosting nutrients. We identified 57 interacting residues as 
      contributors to the protein-ligand binding pocket. Their energy interaction 
      profiles constituted the input features for Machine Learning (ML) models. The 
      consensus of 25 classifiers trained using various ML algorithms attained 93.9% 
      accuracy and a 6.4% false-positive-rate. The consensus of 10 regression models 
      for binding energy prediction also achieved a low root-mean-square error of 1.18 
      kcal/mol. We screened out 120 flavonoid hits first and retained 50 drug-like hits 
      after predefined ADMET filtering to ensure bioavailability and safety profiles. 
      Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations prioritized nine bioactive flavonoids 
      as promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents exhibiting both high structural stability 
      (root-mean-square deviation < 5 Å for 218 ns) and low MM/PBSA binding free energy 
      (<-6 kcal/mol). Among them, KB-2 (PubChem-CID, 14630497) and 
      9-O-Methylglyceofuran (PubChem-CID, 44257401) displayed excellent binding 
      affinity and desirable pharmacokinetic capabilities. These compounds have great 
      potential to serve as oral nutraceuticals with therapeutic and prophylactic 
      properties as care strategies for patients with long-COVID syndrome.

AB  - Escherichia coli and Shigella spp. are leading bacterial causes of acute diarrhea 
      in sub-Saharan Africa and pose risks to global communities, travelers, and the US 
      military. Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in those and other enteric 
      pathogens creates treatment challenges for clinicians. Inappropriate use of 
      antimicrobial drugs, such as azithromycin for viral respiratory infections, 
      increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated AMR trends of 116 E. coli 
      and 109 Shigella spp. isolates obtained from 1,672 pre-COVID-19 (2017-2019) and 
      1,118 post-COVID-19 (2022-2023) human fecal samples from Kenya. Azithromycin 
      resistance increased significantly from before to after COVID-19, from 6.3% to 
      40.4% (p = 0.001). Phenotypic AMR profiles from a subset of isolates were 
      compared with genotypic AMR information derived from whole genome sequencing. The 
      most common AMR gene detected was the macrolide mph(A) gene. This study 
      highlights the need for continued AMR surveillance.

TI  - Can bupropion treat COVID-19-induced brain fog? A case series.
PG  - 189-191
LID - 10.1097/YIC.0000000000000436 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19-induced neurocognitive complications that include brain fog have 
      affected a large portion of individuals who survived COVID-19. These symptoms can 
      include inattention, mental fatigue, forgetfulness, amotivation, and 
      distractibility. This can cause significant anxiety and depression, which may 
      worsen disease progression. To date, there are no known specific treatments that 
      target COVID-19-related brain fog. Here, two patients are presented that develop 
      symptoms of brain fog that persisted after they recovered from an acute COVID-19 
      infection. Both had memory impairment, mental exhaustion, and inattention with 
      associated depressed mood. They were given bupropion extended release and though 
      varied with dosing and time to resolution, they recovered dramatically. The 
      dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor is known to have effects on the 
      brain that may treat symptoms of brain fog including blocking hippocampal cell 
      loss, increased neural activity in the cingulate cortex, and decreasing 
      proinflammatory cytokines. Bupropion may be a possible option for those suffering 
      from this growing and debilitating post-COVID-19 complication.

TI  - Effectiveness of Colchicine for the Treatment of Long COVID: A Randomized 
      Clinical Trial.
PG  - 1462-1470
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.5408 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Long COVID is characterized by persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, with inflammation playing a key role in pathogenesis. Colchicine, an 
      established anti-inflammatory agent, may reduce these symptoms by targeting 
      inflammatory pathways. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the superiority of colchicine over 
      placebo in improving functional outcome at 52 weeks from baseline. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind, 1:1 randomized clinical trial 
      recruited participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistent 
      symptoms from 8 hospitals in 6 states in India between January 2022 and July 
      2023. Individuals were eligible if they had functional limitation (Post-COVID-19 
      Functional Status scale grade 2 or more) and/or elevated inflammatory markers 
      (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein >0.20 mg/dL and/or neutrophil to lymphocyte 
      ratio >5). Outcomes were assessed at 12, 26, and 52 weeks after randomization. 
      Data were analyzed from January to February 2025. INTERVENTIONS: Participants 
      were randomly assigned to receive colchicine, 0.5 mg, once or twice daily, based 
      on body weight, or placebo for 26 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary 
      outcome was the change in distance walked during a 6-minute walk test from 
      baseline to 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes in inflammatory markers 
      and patient-reported outcome measures, such as quality of life, anxiety, 
      depression, fatigue, dyspnea, measured using validated instruments. RESULTS: Of 
      346 participants included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, 209 
      (60.4%) were female, 137 (39.6%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 46 (12) 
      years. At 52 weeks, there was no difference in mean (SD) change in 6-minute walk 
      test distance between the colchicine and placebo groups (colchicine, 35.5 [19.76] 
      m; placebo, 29.96 [19.83] m; mean difference, 5.59 m; 95% CI, -9.00 to 20.18; 
      P = .45). Similar null findings were seen across all predefined outcomes, except 
      for a small, nonclinically relevant difference in the mean (SD) ratio of forced 
      expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (colchicine, -0.02 [0.03]; 
      placebo, -0.06 [0.03]; mean difference, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.07; P = .001). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, among adults with 
      long COVID, colchicine did not improve functional capacity, respiratory function, 
      or inflammatory markers. These findings underscore the need to explore 
      alternative therapeutic approaches for long COVID. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical 
      Trial Registry of India: CTRI/2021/11/038234.

      Germ and Bran Suppresses Inflammatory Responses from SARS-CoV-2 Spike 
      Glycoprotein S1-Induction In Vitro in A549 Lung Cells and THP-1 Macrophages via 
      Inhibition of the NLRP3 Inflammasome Pathway.

AB  - Black rice is a functional food that is high in anthocyanin content, primarily 
      C3G and P3G. It possesses nutraceutical properties that exhibit a range of 
      beneficial effects on human health. Currently, the spike glycoprotein S1 subunit 
      of SARS-CoV-2 (SP) has been reported for its contribution to pathological 
      inflammatory responses in targeting lung tissue and innate immune cells during 
      COVID-19 infection and in the long-COVID phenomenon. Our objectives focused on 
      the health benefits of the C3G and P3G-rich fraction of black rice germ and bran 
      (BR extract) on the inhibition of inflammatory responses induced by SP, as well 
      as the inhibition of NF-kB activation and the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in an in 
      vitro model. In this study, BR extract was identified for its active 
      anthocyanins, C3G and P3G, using the HPLC technique. A549-lung cells and 
      differentiated THP-1 macrophages were treated with BR extract, C3G, or P3G prior 
      to exposure to 100 ng/mL of SP. Their anti-inflammatory properties were then 
      determined. BR extract at concentrations of 12.5−100 μg/mL exhibited 
      anti-inflammation activity for both A549 and THP-1 cells through the significant 
      suppression of NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 inflammatory gene expressions and IL-6, 
      IL-1β, and IL-18 cytokine secretions in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). It 
      was determined that both cell lines, C3G and P3G (at 1.25−10 μg/mL), were 
      compatibly responsible for the significant inhibition of SP-induced inflammatory 
      responses for both gene and protein levels (p < 0.05). With regard to the 
      anti-inflammation mechanism, BR extract, C3G, and P3G could attenuate SP-induced 
      inflammation via counteraction with NF-kB activation and downregulation of the 
      inflammasome-dependent inflammatory pathway proteins (NLRP3, ASC, and capase-1). 
      Overall, the protective effects of anthocyanins obtained from black rice germ and 
      bran can be employed in potentially preventive strategies that use pigmented rice 
      against the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID patients continue to experience unremitting symptoms that 
      extend far beyond the initial illness. While there is rapid accumulation of data 
      on acute COVID treatment in hospitalized patients, little is known regarding 
      post-COVID management. OBJECTIVES: To describe our center's experience treating 
      post-COVID sub-syndromes encountered in Post-COVID Lung Clinic. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively reviewed data on 98 post-COVID patients evaluated in our clinic 
      between 07/01/2020-12/31/2022. We encountered three distinct post-COVID subtypes: 
      1) respiratory complaints associated with increased O2 requirements and abnormal 
      CT findings (post-COVID interstitial lung disease [ILD]), 2) respiratory 
      complaints associated with tachycardia (post-COVID dyspnea-tachycardia syndrome 
      [DTS]). Post-COVID ILD patients (n = 28) received steroids in combination with 
      cell cycle inhibitor (mycophenolate mofetil-MMF). Post-COVID DTS patients (n = 
      16) were treated with metoprolol. 3) A third, undifferentiated group presented 
      with mild respiratory complaints and normal spirometry (n = 17) and was followed 
      in clinic without initiation of a specific treatment. RESULTS: In treated 
      post-COVID ILD patients, mean oxygen requirements at rest (1.96 ± 1.79 L/NC) 
      decreased to 0.89 ± 1.29 L/NC at 6 months follow-up, p = 0.005. In patients with 
      post-COVID DTS, mean heart rate at rest decreased (98 ± 15 bpm to 79 ± 11 bpm) at 
      6 months follow-up, p = 0.023. 60 % of patients reported an improvement in 
      exertional dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS: Our descriptive study presents a single center 
      outpatient COVID-19 clinic experience. We encountered 3 post-COVID sub-syndromes 
      and describe their treatments: post-COVID interstitial lung disease [ILD] treated 
      with a novel regimen of MMF and steroids, post COVID dyspnea-tachycardia syndrome 
      [DTS] treated with metoprolol, and a third subgroup with mild undifferentiated 
      symptoms without specific treatment.

AB  - A 36-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma on maintenance rituximab 
      therapy presented to the emergency department with high fever and fatigue. A 
      chest X-ray showed a lobar infiltrate, 40 days before admission the patient 
      suffered from a mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and fully 
      recovered. PCR nasopharyngeal swab was negative for COVID-19. Comprehensive 
      biochemical, radiological, and pathological evaluation including 
      18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography and 
      transbronchial lung biopsy found no pathogen or lymphoma recurrence. Treatment 
      for pneumonia with antibiotic and antifungal agents was nonbeneficial. A 
      diagnosis of secondary organizing pneumonia (OP) was made after pneumonia 
      migration and a rapid response to corticosteroids. OP secondary to a viral 
      respiratory infection has been well described. Raising awareness for 
      post-COVID-19 OP has therapeutic and prognostic importance because those patients 
      benefit from steroid therapy. We believe the condition described here is 
      underdiagnosed and undertreated by doctors worldwide. Because of the ongoing 
      global pandemic we are now encountering a new kind of patient, patients that have 
      recovered from COVID-19. We hope that this case may contribute to gaining more 
      knowledge about this growing patient population.

AB  - Preliminary studies demonstrated beneficial effects of dietary creatine across 
      different post-viral fatigue syndromes. Creatine is often co-administered with 
      glucose to improve its potency yet whether glucose boost the efficacy of creatine 
      in long COVID remains currently unknown. In this report, we investigate the 
      effects of 8-wk creatine intake with and without glucose on patient-reported 
      outcomes, exercise tolerance, and tissue creatine levels in patients with long 
      COVID. Fifteen male and female long COVID adult patients (age 39.7±16.0 y; 9 
      women) with moderate fatigue and at least one of additional long COVID-related 
      symptoms volunteered to participate in this randomized controlled parallel-group 
      interventional trial. All patients were allocated in a double-blind 
      parallel-group design (1 : 1 : 1) to receive creatine (8 g of creatine 
      monohydrate per day), a mixture of creatine and glucose (8 g of creatine 
      monohydrate and 3 g of glucose per day), or placebo (3 g of glucose per day) 
      t.i.d. during an 8-wk intervention interval. Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures 
      (treatment vs. time interaction) revealed significant differences in changes in 
      total creatine levels between the groups, showing an interaction effect at two 
      brain locations (right precentral white matter F=34.740, p=0.008; partial 
      η(2)=0.72; left paracentral grey matter F=19.243, p=0.019; partial η(2)=0.88), 
      with creatine and creatine-glucose outcompeted placebo to elevate creatine levels 
      at these two locations. Several long COVID symptoms (including body aches, 
      breathing problems, difficulties concentrating, headache, and general malaise) 
      were significantly reduced in creatine-glucose group at 8-wk follow-up (p≤0.05); 
      the effect sizes for reducing body aches, difficulties concentrating, and 
      headache were 1.33, 0.80, and 1.12, respectively, suggesting a large effect of 
      creatine-glucose mixture for these outcomes. Our preliminary findings suggest 
      that supplying exogenous creatine with glucose could be recommended as an 
      effective procedure in replenishing brain creatine pool and alleviating long 
      COVID features in this prevalent condition.

      Nutzen von standardisierten Ginkgo-biloba Extrakten].
PG  - 432-437
LID - 10.1159/000548075 [doi]
AB  - Hintergrund: Long COVID und das Post-COVID-Syndrom sind langfristige Folgen einer 
      SARS-CoV-2-Infektion, die eine Vielzahl physischer, kognitiver und psychischer 
      Symptome hervorrufen können. Dazu gehören Erschöpfung, Atemnot, 
      Gedächtnisstörungen und Schlafprobleme. Die zugrunde liegenden Mechanismen sind 
      noch nicht vollständig geklärt, umfassen jedoch persistierende Viruspartikel, 
      mikrovaskuläre Dysfunktionen, Autoimmunreaktionen und eine Dysregulation des 
      autonomen Nervensystems. Fragestellung: Welchen Nutzen könnten standardisierte 
      Ginkgo-biloba-Extrakte aufgrund ihrer pharmakologischen Wirkungen und ihrer 
      klinischen Wirksamkeit bei Long COVID und Post-COVID-Syndrom bringen? 
      Zusammenfassung: Die Diagnose von Long COVID bleibt aufgrund fehlender 
      standardisierter Tests eine Herausforderung. Therapeutisch wird ein multimodaler 
      Ansatz empfohlen, der symptomatische Medikation, Physiotherapie, Psychotherapie 
      sowie Ernährungs- und Bewegungstherapie umfasst. Ein vielversprechender 
      ergänzender Therapieansatz ist die Verwendung von standardisierten 
      Ginkgo-biloba-Extrakten. Dank ihrer antioxidativen, entzündungshemmenden und 
      neuroprotektiven Eigenschaften könnten sie zur Verbesserung kognitiver 
      Beeinträchtigungen, Fatigue und kardiovaskulärer Symptome beitragen. Erste 
      Studien und Fallberichte deuten auf positive Effekte hin, jedoch sind weitere 
      klinische Untersuchungen erforderlich, um die Wirksamkeit zu bestätigen. 
      Kernaussagen: Long COVID und das Post-COVID-Syndrom betreffen zahlreiche 
      Organsysteme und beeinträchtigen die Lebensqualität erheblich. Die Diagnose 
      bleibt schwierig, da es keine spezifischen Tests gibt. Eine multimodale Therapie 
      ist derzeit der vielversprechendste Behandlungsansatz. Standardisierte 
      Ginkgo-biloba-Extrakte zeigen in ersten Studien positive Effekte auf 
      neurokognitive und kardiovaskuläre Symptome.

TI  - Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant Effects of HIIT in Individuals with Long COVID: 
      Insights into the Potential Role of Triphala.
LID - 10.3390/ijms26178623 [doi]
LID - 8623
AB  - Long COVID is characterized by persistent symptoms associated with chronic 
      inflammation and oxidative stress. While high-intensity interval training (HIIT) 
      and supplementation with antioxidants such as Triphala have demonstrated 
      individual therapeutic benefits, their combined effects remain unclear. This 
      study aimed primarily to evaluate the effects of an 8-week HIIT program on 
      markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and exercise-related symptoms in 
      individuals with long COVID, and secondarily to explore whether Triphala 
      supplementation provided additional benefits. A total of 104 participants (aged 
      18-59 years) were randomized into three groups-control (placebo), HIIT (cycling 
      for 28 min/day, 3 days/week), and combined (HIIT + Triphala, 1000 mg/day)-for 8 
      weeks. The biomarkers assessed included interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis 
      factor-alpha (TNF-α), malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls, and superoxide 
      dismutase (SOD) activity. Following the intervention, significant reductions in 
      IFN-γ, TNF-α, MDA, protein carbonyls, and rating of perceived exertion were 
      observed in both the HIIT and combined groups (p < 0.05), with no significant 
      differences between the two. SOD activity significantly increased in all groups, 
      including the control group (p < 0.05), with no between-group differences. An 
      8-week HIIT program appears to be effective in reducing inflammation, oxidative 
      stress, and dyspnea in individuals with long COVID. Triphala supplementation did 
      not provide any additional statistically significant benefit but was safe and 
      well tolerated.

AB  - While previous research examined coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      antiviral-vaccine interactions through exploratory subgroup analysis, none 
      specifically designed for examining this interaction or its impact on post-acute 
      outcomes. This study examined the interaction between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 
      complete COVID-19 vaccination on reducing the risk of post-acute outcomes among 
      COVID-19 patients. We followed COVID-19 patients hospitalized between 11 March 
      2022 and 10 October 2023, until 31 October 2023 in Hong Kong. Exposure groups 
      were based on nirmatrelvir-ritonavir usage and vaccination status (fully or not 
      fully vaccinated). Post-acute death and all-cause rehospitalization were the 
      study outcomes. Propensity score weighting was applied to balance covariates 
      among exposure groups, including age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and 
      concomitant treatments. Multiplicative and additive interactions between 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and vaccination status were assessed. A total of 50,438 
      COVID-19 patients were included in this study and arranged into four exposure 
      groups. Significant additive interaction on post-acute rehospitalization was 
      observed (relative excess risk, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02-0.19; p-value, 0.018; 
      attributable proportion, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.12; p-value, 0.017; synergy index, 
      1.26; 95% CI, 1.02-1.55; p-value, 0.032). The interaction on post-acute mortality 
      was marginally significant. In the subgroup analysis, the interaction effect is 
      more pronounced in older adults, female, and CoronaVac recipients. In conclusion, 
      our study demonstrated an additive interaction between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 
      complete vaccination on post-acute outcomes, suggesting greater long-term 
      benefits of the antiviral for fully vaccinated individuals compared to not fully 
      vaccinated patients.

TI  - Mortality and its determinants after an outbreak of post COVID-19 associated 
      rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis in Central India.
PG  - 2363-2370
LID - 10.1007/s10792-023-02634-0 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To report cumulative mortality rates using survival analysis from an 
      outbreak of 211 patients with post COVID-19 rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis 
      (ROCM) in central India. METHODS: Case files of eligible patients were evaluated 
      and mucor was identified from deep nasal swabs using freshly prepared KOH mount. 
      All patients underwent contrast enhanced MRI and disease staging was done based 
      on the extent of anatomical involvement. All patients received intravenous 
      Amphotericin B and sinus debridement was done when possible. Orbital exenteration 
      was reserved for patients with advanced orbital disease. RESULTS: The mean age 
      was 50.7 ± 10.2 of which 147 (70%) were men. At presentation, ROCM was limited to 
      sinuses in 72 (34%), orbital extension was seen in 102 (48%) and 31 (15%) had CNS 
      extension. Sinus debridement was possible in 82% cases (n = 173). Thirty-five 
      (16.6%) patients died due to ROCM. The mean follow-up of patients who survived 
      was 126.6 ± 16.4 days. The cumulative mortality rate at day 10 was 4.8% 
      (95%CI = 2.6-8.8%) and increased 13.1% (95%CI = 9.1-18.7%) at day 30 and to 18.4% 
      (95%CI = 13.6-24.8%) at day 60. Majority of deaths (n = 26, 75%) occurred within 
      1-month of ROCM presentation. Multivariable hazards analysis showed that patients 
      with CNS involvement had a 6.5 times higher risk of death (Hazard Ratio = 6.71, 
      95% CI = 2.9-15.5, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We report significantly lower 
      mortality rates compared to recent literature that varies from 30 to 80% at 
      1-month follow-up. Timely sinus debridement and systemic Amphotericin B can help 
      reduce mortality. Presence of CNS extension significantly increased the mortality 
      risk with patients with ROCM.

TI  - Factors associated with poor outcomes in SLE patients with COVID-19: Data from 
      ReumaCoV-Brazil register.
PG  - 42-53
LID - 10.1177/09612033221135884 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate factors associated with COVID-19 severity outcomes in 
      patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: This was a 
      cross-sectional analysis of baseline data of a prospective, multi-stage cohort 
      study-"The ReumaCoV Brazil"-designed to monitor patients with immune-mediated 
      rheumatologic disease (IMRD) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SLE adult patients 
      with COVID-19 were compared with those without COVID-19. SLE activity was 
      evaluated by the patient global assessment (PGA) and SLE Disease Activity Index 
      2000 (SLEDAI-2K). RESULTS: 604 SLE patients were included, 317 (52.4%) with 
      COVID-19 and 287 (47.6%) in the control group. SLE COVID-19 patients reported a 
      lower frequency of social isolation and worked more frequently as health 
      professionals. There was no difference in the mean SLEDAI-2K score between groups 
      in the post-COVID-19 period (5.8 [8.6] vs. 4.5 [8.0]; p = 0.190). However, 
      infected patients reported increased SLE activity according to the Patient Global 
      Assessment (PGA) during this period (2.9 [2.9] vs. 2.3 [2.6]; p = 0.031. Arterial 
      hypertension (OR 2.48 [CI 95% 1.04-5.91], p = 0.041), cyclophosphamide (OR 14.32 
      [CI 95% 2.12-96.77], p = 0.006), dyspnea (OR: 7.10 [CI 95% 3.10-16.23], p < 
      0.001) and discontinuation of SLE treatment medication during infection (5.38 [CI 
      95% 1.97-15.48], p = 0.002), were independently associated with a higher chance 
      of hospitalization related to COVID-19. Patients who received telemedicine 
      support presented a 67% lower chance of hospitalization (OR 0.33 [CI 95% 
      0.12-0.88], p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Hypertension and cyclophosphamide were 
      associated with a severe outcome, and telemedicine can be a useful tool for SLE 
      patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Co-ultraPEALut in Subjective Cognitive Impairment Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection: 
      An Exploratory Retrospective Study.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci14030293 [doi]
LID - 293
AB  - Neurological involvement following coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is thought 
      to have a neuroinflammatory etiology. Co-ultraPEALut (an anti-inflammatory 
      molecule) and luteolin (an anti-oxidant) have shown promising results as 
      neuroinflammation antagonists. The aim of this study was to describe cognitive 
      impairment in patients with post-COVID-19 treated with co-ultraPEALut. The 
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Prospective-Retrospective Memory 
      Questionnaire (PRMQ), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and a subjective 
      assessment were administered at baseline and after 10 months. Patients treated 
      with co-ultraPEALut were retrospectively compared with controls. Twenty-six 
      patients treated with co-ultraPEALut showed a significant improvement in PRMQ 
      (T0: 51.94 ± 10.55, T1: 39.67 ± 13.02, p < 0.00001) and MoCA raw score (T0: 25.76 
      ± 2.3, T1: 27.2 ± 2, p 0.0260); the MoCA-adjusted score and the FSS 
      questionnaires also showed an improvement, even though it was not statistically 
      significant; and 80.77% of patients reported a subjective improvement. In the 
      control subjects (n = 15), the improvement was not as pronounced (PRMQ T0: 45.77 
      ± 13.47, T1: 42.33 ± 16.86, p 0.2051; FSS T0: 4.95 ± 1.57, T1: 4.06 ± 1.47, p 
      0.1352). Patients treated with co-ultraPEALut and corticosteroids were not 
      statistically different from those treated with co-ultraPEALut alone. 
      Neuro-post-COVID-19 patients treated with co-ultraPEALut scored better than 
      controls in MoCA and PRMQ questionnaires after 10 months: this may support the 
      importance of neuroinflammation modulation for neuro-long-COVID-19.

      Symptom-Associated Drug Prescriptions.
PG  - 641-649
LID - 10.1248/bpb.b24-00762 [doi]
AB  - Long coronavirus disease (COVID) is characterized by symptoms persisting or 
      reappearing at least 2 months post-recovery from acute coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19). Although Long COVID symptoms have been widely studied, data on drug 
      prescriptions for patients with Long COVID in Japan remain limited. Therefore, 
      this study aimed to analyze drug utilization patterns for Long COVID treatment 
      using a nationwide database in Japan, with the goal of providing basic data to 
      support the establishment of standard treatments in the future. The Medical Data 
      Vision COVID-19 dataset was used to identify patients diagnosed with Long COVID 
      between January 15, 2020 and December 31, 2022. Symptoms and prescribed 
      medications were extracted, and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the 
      relationship between symptoms and drug prescriptions. Among 652016 patients with 
      COVID-19, 3769 (0.6%) developed Long COVID. Common symptoms included fatigue, 
      bronchial asthma-like symptoms, and insomnia. Acetaminophen was the most 
      prescribed drug in the first month of diagnosis. Other frequently prescribed 
      drugs included dextromethorphan, l-carbocisteine, and polaprezinc. From 3 months 
      post-diagnosis, prescriptions for Hochu-ekki-to (a traditional Japanese herbal 
      medicine; Kampo medicine) and polaprezinc increased, especially among patients 
      aged 30-50 years. Long COVID in Japan is characterized by a wide range of 
      symptoms, leading to symptom-based drug prescriptions, particularly fatigue, 
      respiratory issues, and taste disturbances. These findings offer insights into 
      the pharmacological management of Long COVID in Japan, highlighting the need for 
      further research on optimal treatments in the future.

TI  - Persistent COVID-19 parosmia and olfactory loss post olfactory training: 
      randomized clinical trial comparing central and peripheral-acting therapeutics.
PG  - 3671-3678
LID - 10.1007/s00405-024-08548-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Although COVID-19 anosmia is often transient, patients with persistent 
      olfactory dysfunction (pOD) can experience refractory parosmia and diminished 
      smell. This study evaluated four putative therapies for parosmia in patients with 
      chronic COVID-19 olfactory impairment. METHODS: After screening nasal endoscopy, 
      85 patients (49 female, 58%) with pOD and treatment-refractory parosmia were 
      randomized to: (1) ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin + olfactory 
      training (OT) (umPEALUT group, n = 17), (2) alpha-lipoic acid + OT (ALA group, 
      n = 21), (3) umPEALUT + ALA + OT (combination group, n = 28), or 4) olfactory 
      training (OT) alone (control group, n = 23). Olfactory function was assessed at 
      baseline (T(0)) and 6 months (T(1)) using a parosmia questionnaire and Sniffin' 
      Sticks test of odor threshold, detection, and identification (TDI). Analyses 
      included one-way ANOVA for numeric data and Chi-Square analyses for nominal data 
      on parosmia. RESULTS: The umPEALUT group had the largest improvement in TDI 
      scores (21.8 ± 9.4 to 29.7 ± 7.5) followed by the combination group (19.6 ± 6.29 
      to 27.5 ± 2.7), both p < 0.01. The control and ALA groups had no significant 
      change. Patients in the combination and umPEALUT groups had significantly 
      improved TDI scores compared to ALA and control groups (p < 0.001). Rates of 
      parosmia resolution after 6 months were reported at 96% for combination, 65% for 
      control, 53% for umPEALUT and 29% for ALA (p < 0.001). All treatment regimens 
      were well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: umPEALUT and OT, with or without ALA, was 
      associated with improvement in TDI scores and parosmia, whereas OT alone or OT 
      with ALA were associated with little benefit.

TI  - Ketamine Infusion for Refractory Post-COVID-19 Fatigue: Case Report.
PG  - 45-47
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) symptoms are common after COVID-19 
      infections and despite recent efforts to study and treat, limited progress has 
      been made. The most common of the symptoms, fatigue, can be debilitating and lack 
      effective treatment options, and as a result, the need for potential management 
      options is paramount. CASE REPORT: We present a case report of a patient with 
      refractory PCS fatigue. Following intravenous ketamine infusion, the patient 
      noted significant improvement in his energy and fatigue symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      report the successful use of ketamine infusion for PCS fatigue symptoms.

TI  - Identification of a characteristic VOCs pattern in the exhaled breath of 
      post-COVID subjects: are metabolic alterations induced by the infection still 
      detectable?
LID - 10.1088/1752-7163/ace27c [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is expected to cause metabolic alterations due to viral replication 
      and the host immune response resulting in increase of cytokine secretion and 
      cytolytic activity. The present prospective observational study is addressed at 
      exploring the potentialities of breath analysis in discrimination between 
      patients with a documented previous history of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      and, at the moment of the enrollment, exhibiting a negative nasopharyngeal swab 
      and acquired immunity (post-COVID) and healthy subjects with no evidence of 
      previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (no-COVID). The main purpose is to understand if 
      traces of metabolic alterations induced during the acute phase of the infection 
      are still detectable after negativization, in the form of a characteristic 
      volatile organic compound (VOC) pattern. An overall number of 60 volunteers aged 
      between 25 and 70 years were enrolled in the study (post-COVID: n.30; no-COVID: 
      n. 30), according to well-determined criteria. Breath and ambient air samples 
      were collected by means of an automated sampling system (Mistral) and analyzed by 
      thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS). Statistical 
      tests (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test) and multivariate data analysis (principal 
      component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis) were performed on data 
      sets. Among all compounds detected (76 VOCs in 90% of breath samples), 5 VOCs 
      (1-propanol, isopropanol, 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethanol, propanal and 
      4-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)phenol) showed abundances in breath samples collected from 
      post-COVID subjects significantly different with respect to those collected from 
      no-COVID group (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test,p-values <0.05). Although not 
      completely satisfactory separation between the groups was obtained, variables 
      showing significant differences between the two groups and higher loadings for 
      PCA are recognized biomarkers of COVID-19, according to previous studies in 
      literature. Therefore, based on the outcomes obtained, traces of metabolic 
      alterations induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection are still detectable after 
      negativization. This evidence raises questions about the eligibility of 
      post-COVID subjects in observational studies addressed at the detection of 
      COVID-19. (Ethical Committee Registration number: 120/AG/11).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Comprehensive data on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile in 
      patients with COVID-19 and neurological involvement from large-scale multicenter 
      studies are missing so far. OBJECTIVE: To analyze systematically the CSF profile 
      in COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 150 lumbar punctures in 127 
      patients with PCR-proven COVID-19 and neurological symptoms seen at 17 European 
      university centers RESULTS: The most frequent pathological finding was blood-CSF 
      barrier (BCB) dysfunction (median QAlb 11.4 [6.72-50.8]), which was present in 
      58/116 (50%) samples from patients without pre-/coexisting CNS diseases (group 
      I). QAlb remained elevated > 14d (47.6%) and even > 30d (55.6%) after 
      neurological onset. CSF total protein was elevated in 54/118 (45.8%) samples 
      (median 65.35 mg/dl [45.3-240.4]) and strongly correlated with QAlb. The CSF 
      white cell count (WCC) was increased in 14/128 (11%) samples (mostly 
      lympho-monocytic; median 10 cells/µl, > 100 in only 4). An albuminocytological 
      dissociation (ACD) was found in 43/115 (37.4%) samples. CSF L-lactate was 
      increased in 26/109 (24%; median 3.04 mmol/l [2.2-4]). CSF-IgG was elevated in 
      50/100 (50%), but was of peripheral origin, since QIgG was normal in almost all 
      cases, as were QIgA and QIgM. In 58/103 samples (56%) pattern 4 oligoclonal bands 
      (OCB) compatible with systemic inflammation were present, while CSF-restricted 
      OCB were found in only 2/103 (1.9%). SARS-CoV-2-CSF-PCR was negative in 76/76 
      samples. Routine CSF findings were normal in 35%. Cytokine levels were frequently 
      elevated in the CSF (often associated with BCB dysfunction) and serum, partly 
      remaining positive at high levels for weeks/months (939 tests). Of note, a 
      positive SARS-CoV-2-IgG-antibody index (AI) was found in 2/19 (10.5%) patients 
      which was associated with unusually high WCC in both of them and a strongly 
      increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) index in one (not tested in the other). 
      Anti-neuronal/anti-glial autoantibodies were mostly absent in the CSF and serum 
      (1509 tests). In samples from patients with pre-/coexisting CNS disorders (group 
      II [N = 19]; including multiple sclerosis, JC-virus-associated immune 
      reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, HSV/VZV encephalitis/meningitis, CNS 
      lymphoma, anti-Yo syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage), CSF findings were mostly 
      representative of the respective disease. CONCLUSIONS: The CSF profile in 
      COVID-19 with neurological symptoms is mainly characterized by BCB disruption in 
      the absence of intrathecal inflammation, compatible with cerebrospinal 
      endotheliopathy. Persistent BCB dysfunction and elevated cytokine levels may 
      contribute to both acute symptoms and 'long COVID'. Direct infection of the CNS 
      with SARS-CoV-2, if occurring at all, seems to be rare. Broad differential 
      diagnostic considerations are recommended to avoid misinterpretation of treatable 
      coexisting neurological disorders as complications of COVID-19.

TI  - "The idea is to help people achieve greater success and liberty": A qualitative 
      study of expanded methadone take-home access in opioid use disorder treatment.
PG  - 1143-1150
LID - 10.1080/08897077.2022.2060438 [doi]
AB  - Background: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States (US) was already 
      facing an epidemic of opioid overdose deaths. Overdose deaths continued to surge 
      during the pandemic. To limit COVID-19 spread and to avoid disruptions in access 
      to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including buprenorphine and 
      methadone, US federal and state agencies granted unprecedented exemptions to 
      existing MOUD guidelines for Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs), including 
      loosening criteria for unsupervised take-home doses. We conducted a qualitative 
      study to evaluate the impact of these policy changes on MOUD treatment 
      experiences for providers and patients at an OTP in California. Methods: We 
      interviewed 10 providers (including two physicians, five social worker 
      associates, and three nurse practitioners) and 20 patients receiving MOUD. We 
      transcribed, coded, and analyzed all interviews to identify emergent themes. 
      Results: Patient participants were middle-aged (median age 51 years) and were 
      predominantly men (53%). Providers discussed clinical decision-making processes 
      and experiences providing take-homes. Implementation of expanded take-home 
      policies was cautious. Providers reported making individualized decisions, using 
      patient factors to decide if benefits outweighed risks of overdose and misuse. 
      Decision-making factors included patient drug use, overdose risk, housing status, 
      and vulnerability to COVID-19. New patient groups started receiving take-homes 
      and providers noted few adverse events. Patients who received take-homes reported 
      increased autonomy and treatment flexibility, which in turn increased likelihood 
      of treatment stabilization and engagement. Patients who remained ineligible for 
      take-homes, usually due to ongoing non-prescribed opioid or benzodiazepine use, 
      desired greater transparency and shared decision-making. Conclusion: Federal 
      exemptions in response to COVID-19 led to the unprecedented expansion of access 
      to MOUD take-homes within OTPs. Providers and patients perceived benefits to 
      expanding access to take-homes and experienced few adverse outcomes, suggesting 
      expanded take-home policies should remain post-COVID-19. Future studies should 
      explore whether these findings are generalizable to other OTPs and assess larger 
      samples to quantify patient-level outcomes resulting from expanded take-home 
      policies.

      Breath Gas Sensing.
PG  - 1564-1578
LID - 10.1021/acssensors.4c02280 [doi]
AB  - Long COVID (LC) is a great global health concern, affecting individuals 
      recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The persistent and varied symptoms across 
      multiple organs complicate diagnosis and management, and an incomplete 
      understanding of the condition hinders advancements in therapeutics. Current 
      diagnostic methods face challenges related to standardization and completeness. 
      To overcome this, new technologies such as sensor-based electronic noses are 
      being explored for LC assessment, offering a noninvasive screening approach via 
      volatile organic compounds (VOC) sensing in exhaled breath. Although specific 
      LC-associated VOCs have not been fully characterized, insights from COVID-19 
      research suggest their potential as biomarkers. Additionally, AI-driven 
      chemometrics are promising in identifying and predicting outcomes; despite 
      challenges, AI-driven technologies hold the potential to enhance LC evaluation, 
      providing rapid and accurate diagnostics for improved patient care and outcomes. 
      This review underscores the importance of emerging and sensing technologies and 
      comprehensive diagnostic strategies to address screening and treatment challenges 
      in the face of LC.

AB  - COVID-19 has been a growing global concern in the past four years. Several 
      syndromes associated with this multi-organ viral infection have been observed 
      since the outbreak. According to estimates, 10-15% of people with SARS-CoV- 
      infection may have post-COVID-19 syndrome. Even months after infection, common 
      residual signs and symptoms include myalgia, exhaustion, shortness of breath, 
      rapid heartbeat, stroke, and memory and cognitive impairment which can negatively 
      affect survivors' quality of life and may consequently lead to their death. 
      Therefore, it is necessary to think about potential therapy options for dealing 
      with both short and long-term impacts. Paracetamol (a common analgesic and 
      antipyretic) and Dexketoprofen Trometamol (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drug) are used together to relieve post-COVID symptoms like myalgia (muscle pain) 
      and headache. Additionally, to prevent thrombotic events, Rivaroxaban is 
      recommended for 35 days following discharge. Thus an eco-friendly HPLC-DAD 
      technique was developed for simultaneous quantification of Paracetamol, 
      Dexketoprofen Trometamol, and Rivaroxaban which are co-administered for treatment 
      of post-COVID-19 syndrome. The suggested method was found to be linear in the 
      concentration ranges of 3.00-45.00 µg/mL, 0.5-50.00 µg/mL, and 0.15-20.00 µg/mL, 
      and a limit of detection down to 0.531 µg/mL, 0.095 µg/mL and 0.047 µg/mL for 
      Paracetamol, Dexketoprofen Trometamol and Rivaroxaban, respectively. This method 
      was effectively used to quantify the studied drugs in their bulk powder and 
      spiked human plasma with high percentage recoveries (96.55-99.46%). The suggested 
      approach was validated per International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
      requirements and found to be within the acceptable ranges. The method was 
      developed using Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC) principles, with the solvents 
      used and run time having a significant effect on the method's greenness. 
      "Non-toxic" ethanol served as the organic modifier in the mobile phase, moreover, 
      the total run time was 12 min making it suitable for the routine analysis of the 
      mentioned drugs in plasma samples. To get a full image of the method's greenness 
      profile; two most recent greenness assessment tools, the Green Analytical 
      Procedure Index (GAPI), and the Analytical GREEnness metric (AGREE), were 
      employed, with White Analytical Chemistry (WAC) principles proving its 
      environmental safety.

AB  - The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is still a major health problem. Newly emerging 
      variants and long-COVID-19 represent a challenge for the global health system. In 
      particular, individuals in developing countries with insufficient health care 
      need easily accessible, affordable and effective treatments of COVID-19. Previous 
      studies have demonstrated the efficacy of functional inhibitors of acid 
      sphingomyelinase against infections with various viruses, including early 
      variants of SARS-CoV-2. This work investigated whether the acid sphingomyelinase 
      inhibitors fluoxetine and sertraline, usually used as antidepressant molecules in 
      clinical practice, can inhibit the replication of the former and recently emerged 
      SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro. Fluoxetine and sertraline potently inhibited the 
      infection with pseudotyped virus-like particles and SARS-CoV-2 variants D614G, 
      alpha, delta, omicron BA.1 and omicron BA.5. These results highlight fluoxetine 
      and sertraline as priority candidates for large-scale phase 3 clinical trials at 
      different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections, either alone or in combination with 
      other medications.

TI  - Feasibility Study of Developing a Saline-Based Antiviral Nanoformulation 
      Containing Lipid-Soluble EGCG: A Potential Nasal Drug to Treat Long COVID.

AB  - A recent estimate indicates that up to 23.7 million Americans suffer from long 
      COVID, and approximately one million workers may be out of the workforce each day 
      due to associated symptoms, leading to a USD 50 billion annual loss of salary. 
      Post-COVID (Long COVID) neurologic symptoms are due to the initial robust 
      replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasal neuroepithelial cells, leading to 
      inflammation of the olfactory epithelium (OE) and the central nervous system 
      (CNS), and the OE becoming a persistent infection site. Previously, our group 
      showed that Epigallocatechin-3-gallate-palmitate (EC16) nanoformulations possess 
      strong antiviral activity against human coronavirus, suggesting this green 
      tea-derived compound in nanoparticle formulations could be developed as an 
      intranasally delivered new drug to eliminate the persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      leading to restored olfactory function and reduced inflammation in the CNS. The 
      objective of the current study was to determine the compatibility of the 
      nanoformulations with human nasal primary epithelial cells (HNpECs). METHODS: 
      Nanoparticle size was measured using the ZetaView Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis 
      (NTA) system; contact antiviral activity was determined by TCID50 assay for 
      cytopathic effect on MRC-5 cells; post-infection inhibition activity was 
      determined in HNpECs; and cytotoxicity for these cells was determined using an 
      MTT assay. The rapid inactivation of OC43 (a β-coronavirus) and 229E 
      (α-coronavirus) viruses was further characterized by transmission electron 
      microscopy. RESULTS: A saline-based nanoformulation containing 0.1% w/v EC16 was 
      able to inactivate 99.9999% β-coronavirus OC43 on direct contact within 1 min. 
      After a 10-min incubation of infected HNpECs with a formulation containing 
      drug-grade EC16 (EGCG-4' mono-palmitate or EC16m), OC43 viral replication was 
      inhibited by 99%. In addition, all nanoformulations tested for their effect on 
      cell viability were comparable to normal saline, a regularly used nasal 
      irrigation solution. A 1-min incubation of an EC16 nanoformulation with either 
      OC43 or 229E showed an altered viral structure. CONCLUSION: Nanoformulations 
      containing EC16 showed properties compatible with nasal application to rapidly 
      inactivate SARS-CoV-2 residing in the olfactory mucosa and to reduce inflammation 
      in the CNS, pending additional formulation and safety studies.

TI  - Prevalent Metformin Use in Adults With Diabetes and the Incidence of Long COVID: 
      An EHR-Based Cohort Study From the RECOVER Program.
PG  - 1930-1940
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies show metformin use before and during SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      reduces severe COVID-19 and postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) in adults. 
      Our objective was to describe the incidence of PASC and possible associations 
      with prevalent metformin use in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analysis using the 
      National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) and Patient-Centered Clinical Research 
      Network (PCORnet) electronic health record (EHR) databases with an active 
      comparator design that examined metformin-exposed individuals versus 
      nonmetformin-exposed individuals who were taking other diabetes medications. T2DM 
      was defined by HbA1c ≥6.5 or T2DM EHR diagnosis code. The outcome was death or 
      PASC within 6 months, defined by EHR code or computable phenotype. RESULTS: In 
      the N3C, the hazard ratio (HR) for death or PASC with a U09.9 diagnosis code 
      (PASC-U09.0) was 0.79 (95% CI 0.71-0.88; P < 0.001), and for death or N3C 
      computable phenotype PASC (PASC-N3C) was 0.85 (95% CI 0.78-0.92; P < 0.001). In 
      PCORnet, the HR for death or PASC-U09.9 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.66-1.14; P = 0.08), 
      and for death or PCORnet computable phenotype PASC (PASC-PCORnet) was 1.04 (95% 
      CI 0.97-1.11; P = 0.58). Incident PASC by diagnosis code was 1.6% metformin vs. 
      2.0% comparator in the N3C, and 2.1% metformin vs. 2.5% comparator in PCORnet. By 
      computable phenotype, incidence was 4.8% metformin and 5.2% comparator in the N3C 
      and 24.7% metformin vs. 26.1% comparator in PCORnet. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalent 
      metformin use is associated with a slightly lower incidence of death or PASC 
      after SARS-CoV-2 infection. PASC incidence by computable phenotype is higher than 
      by EHR code, especially in PCORnet. These data are consistent with other 
      observational analyses showing prevalent metformin is associated with favorable 
      outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults with T2DM.

TI  - Conceptual foundations of acetylcarnitine supplementation in neuropsychiatric 
      long COVID syndrome: a narrative review.
PG  - 1829-1845
LID - 10.1007/s00406-023-01734-3 [doi]
AB  - Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 can present as multi-organ pathology, with 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms being the most common symptom complex, characterizing 
      long COVID as a syndrome with a significant disease burden for affected 
      individuals. Several typical symptoms of long COVID, such as fatigue, depressive 
      symptoms and cognitive impairment, are also key features of other psychiatric 
      disorders such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and 
      major depressive disorder (MDD). However, clinically successful treatment 
      strategies are still lacking and are often inspired by treatment options for 
      diseases with similar clinical presentations, such as ME/CFS. Acetylcarnitine, 
      the shortest metabolite of a class of fatty acid metabolites called 
      acylcarnitines and one of the most abundant blood metabolites in humans can be 
      used as a dietary/nutritional supplement with proven clinical efficacy in the 
      treatment of MDD, ME/CFS and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Basic research in 
      recent decades has established acylcarnitines in general, and acetylcarnitine in 
      particular, as important regulators and indicators of mitochondrial function and 
      other physiological processes such as neuroinflammation and energy production 
      pathways. In this review, we will compare the clinical basis of neuropsychiatric 
      long COVID with other fatigue-associated diseases. We will also review common 
      molecular disease mechanisms associated with altered acetylcarnitine metabolism 
      and the potential of acetylcarnitine to interfere with these as a therapeutic 
      agent. Finally, we will review the current evidence for acetylcarnitine as a 
      supplement in the treatment of fatigue-associated diseases and propose future 
      research strategies to investigate the potential of acetylcarnitine as a 
      treatment option for long COVID.

TI  - COVID-19 Vaccination and Gout Flare Risk in Patients With Infrequent or Frequent 
      Flares: A Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 131-139
LID - 10.1002/acr.25215 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess post-COVID-19 vaccination gout flare risk with differing 
      baseline flare burden. METHODS: We prospectively studied gout patients with 
      infrequent or frequent flares, defined as ≤1 flare/year or ≥2 flares/year, 
      respectively. COVID-19 vaccine-naive patients managed with urate-lowering therapy 
      between February and June 2021 were included and voluntarily decided on 
      vaccination. Participants were followed for 12 weeks after enrollment or first 
      vaccine dose. Gout flares and risk factors were compared between groups. RESULTS: 
      Of 530 participants, 308 (58.1%) had infrequent flares and 222 (41.9%) had 
      frequent flares at baseline, with 248 (142 infrequent and 106 frequent) receiving 
      two-dose COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccination increased cumulative flare incidence 
      at 12 weeks in the infrequent but not the frequent flare group (26.1% vs 10.8%, P 
      = 0.001, compared with 60.4% vs 65.5%, P = 0.428). Flare incidence in the final 
      4 weeks of observation decreased significantly only in the vaccinated infrequent 
      flare group (4.3% vs 12.0%, P = 0.017). Multivariable analyses showed that 
      vaccination (odds ratio [OR] 2.82, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.50-5.30, P 
      = 0.001), flare in the preceding year (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.03-3.71, P = 0.04), and 
      body mass index (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.19, P = 0.03) were independently 
      associated with increased flare risk in the infrequent flare group. Baseline 
      serum urate (mg/dl) was an independent risk factor in the frequent flare group 
      (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.05-1.45, P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccination was 
      associated with increased early gout flares only in patients with previously 
      infrequent flares.

TI  - In silico inquest reveals the efficacy of Cannabis in the treatment of 
      post-Covid-19 related neurodegeneration.

AB  - Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the Covid-19 pandemic has proved 
      itself as the deadliest pathogen. A major portion of the population has become 
      susceptible to this strain. Scientists are pushing their limits to formulate a 
      vaccine against Covid-19 with the least side effects. Although the recent 
      discoveries of vaccines have shown some relief from the covid infection rate, 
      however, physical fatigue, mental abnormalities, inflammation and other multiple 
      organ damages are arising as post-Covid symptoms. The long-term effects of these 
      symptoms are massive. Patients with such symptoms are known as long-haulers and 
      treatment strategy against this condition is still unknown. In this study, we 
      tried to explore a strategy to deal with the post-Covid symptoms. We targeted 
      three human proteins namely ACE2, Interleukin-6, Transmembrane serine protease 
      and NRP1 which are already reported to be damaged via Covid-19 proteins and 
      upregulated in the post-Covid stage. Our target plant in this study is Cannabis 
      (popularly known as 'Ganja' in India). The molecular docking and simulation 
      studies revealed that Cannabidiol (CBD) and Cannabivarin (CVN) obtained from 
      Cannabis can bind to post-Covid symptoms related central nervous system (CNS) 
      proteins and downregulate them which can be beneficial in post-covid symptoms 
      treatment strategy. Thus we propose Cannabis as an important therapeutic plant 
      against post-Covid symptoms.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - Mitochondria are increasingly recognized as central arbiters of cellular fate, 
      placing them at the nexus of pulmonary health and disease. Beyond their canonical 
      role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, these organelles are critical 
      hubs for redox signaling, metabolic homeostasis, and programmed cell death. 
      Mitochondrial dysfunction-a multifaceted condition characterized by impaired 
      bioenergetics, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, aberrant 
      dynamics, and defective quality control via mitophagy-is a unifying pathogenic 
      feature in chronic lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and pulmonary arterial hypertension 
      (PAH). This dysfunction is also a critical determinant of severity in acute 
      conditions like acute lung injury (ALI) and COVID-19 and is a key mechanistic 
      driver of Long COVID. This review synthesizes the core mechanisms of 
      mitochondrial impairment, delineates their specific contributions to this 
      spectrum of pulmonary pathologies, and discusses the burgeoning field of 
      mitochondria-targeted therapeutics. Strategies ranging from targeted antioxidants 
      and metabolic modulators to novel regenerative approaches like mitochondrial 
      transplantation are highlighted, with an expanded discussion on their 
      limitations, challenges, and clinical implications. By framing mitochondrial 
      integrity as a critical determinant of pulmonary disease, we underscore a pivotal 
      axis for future diagnostic and therapeutic innovation.

TI  - Intersection of the Web-Based Vaping Narrative With COVID-19: Topic Modeling 
      Study.

LID - e21743
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak was designated a global pandemic on March 11, 
      2020. The relationship between vaping and contracting COVID-19 is unclear, and 
      information on the internet is conflicting. There is some scientific evidence 
      that vaping cannabidiol (CBD), an active ingredient in cannabis that is obtained 
      from the hemp plant, or other substances is associated with more severe 
      manifestations of COVID-19. However, there is also inaccurate information that 
      vaping can aid COVID-19 treatment, as well as expert opinion that CBD, possibly 
      administered through vaping, can mitigate COVID-19 symptoms. Thus, it is 
      necessary to study the spread of inaccurate information to better understand how 
      to promote scientific knowledge and curb inaccurate information, which is 
      critical to the health of vapers. Inaccurate information about vaping and 
      COVID-19 may affect COVID-19 treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Using structural 
      topic modeling, we aimed to map temporal trends in the web-based vaping narrative 
      (a large data set comprising web-based vaping chatter from several sources) to 
      indicate how the narrative changed from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      METHODS: We obtained data using a textual query that scanned a data pool of 
      approximately 200,000 different domains (4,027,172 documents and 361,100,284 
      words) such as public internet forums, blogs, and social media, from August 1, 
      2019, to April 21, 2020. We then used structural topic modeling to understand 
      changes in word prevalence and semantic structures within topics around vaping 
      before and after December 31, 2019, when COVID-19 was reported to the World 
      Health Organization. RESULTS: Broadly, the web-based vaping narrative can be 
      organized into the following groups or archetypes: harms from vaping; Vaping 
      Regulation; Vaping as Harm Reduction or Treatment; and Vaping Lifestyle. Three 
      archetypes were observed prior to the emergence of COVID-19; however, four 
      archetypes were identified post-COVID-19 (Vaping as Harm Reduction or Treatment 
      was the additional archetype). A topic related to CBD product preference emerged 
      after COVID-19 was first reported, which may be related to the use of CBD by 
      vapers as a COVID-19 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our main finding is the emergence of 
      a vape-administered CBD treatment narrative around COVID-19 when comparing the 
      web-based vaping narratives before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. These 
      results are key to understanding how vapers respond to inaccurate information 
      about COVID-19, optimizing treatment of vapers who contract COVID-19, and 
      possibly minimizing instances of inaccurate information. The findings have 
      implications for the management of COVID-19 among vapers and the monitoring of 
      web-based content pertinent to tobacco to develop targeted interventions to 
      manage COVID-19 among vapers.

AB  - PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the emergence of a secondary public 
      health crisis known as Long COVID. It is estimated that approximately 10% of 
      individuals who contact COVID-19 develop Long COVID, with fatigue and brain fog 
      being among the most commonly reported and debilitating symptoms. However, no 
      standardized or effective treatments are currently available. This observational 
      study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of MYP(plus), an herbal formulation composed 
      of Astragali Radix, Salviae Radix, and Aquilariae Lignum, in alleviating fatigue 
      and brain fog in patients with Long COVID. METHODS: Subjects with a score of 60 
      or higher on the Modified Korean version of the Chalder Fatigue scale (mKCFQ11) 
      or a brain fog rating of 5 or higher on the visual analogue scale (VAS) took two 
      capsules of MYP(plus) (500 mg per capsule) twice daily for 4 weeks. Changes in 
      symptoms were assessed using the mKCFQ11, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory 
      (MFI-20), Fatigue VAS, Brain fog VAS, and overall quality of life using the 
      Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Additionally, levels of three cytokines (TNF-α, 
      TGF-β, IFN- γ) and cortisol were measured. RESULTS: Fifty participants 
      successfully completed the 4-week administration with MYP(plus). At baseline, 
      fatigue severity was 75.3 ± 10.9 in mKCFQ11, 70.9 ± 11.2 in MFI-20, 7.5 ± 1.2 in 
      Fatigue VAS, 8.4 ± 1.1 in Brain fog VAS, and 45.3 ± 17.8 in SF-12. All parameters 
      significantly improved (p < 0.01), with a decrease of 46% in mKCFQ11, 26% in 
      MFI-20, 49% in Fatigue VAS, and 52% in Brain fog VAS, and an increase of 59% in 
      SF-12, respectively. Unlikely others, the plasma level of TGF-β showed a 
      declining pattern after MYP(plus) administration (from 765.0 ± 1759.7 to 
      243.9 ± 708.1 pg/mL, p = 0.07). No safety concerns were observed. CONCLUSION: 
      This pilot observational study suggests the clinical potential of MYP(plus) for 
      managing patients with Long COVID, focusing on fatigue-related symptoms and 
      quality of life. Further studies are required to confirm its efficacy and safety 
      using large-scale randomized placebo-controlled trials in the future. PROTOCOL 
      REGISTRATION: This study has been retrospectively registered with the identifier 
      number KCT0008948 on https://cris.nih.go.kr , as of 27/10/23.

TI  - Post Covid telogen effluvium: the diagnostic value of serum ferritin biomarker 
      and the preventive value of dietary supplements. a case control study.

AB  - Telogen effluvium is characterized by excessive hair shedding usually following a 
      stressful event. Ferritin has been used in clinical practice as a biomarker of 
      nonanemic iron deficiency in cases of telogen effluvium. During the years of the 
      COVID19 pandemic, telogen effluvium was reported as a part of post covid 
      manifestations. As ferritin was also a biomarker for inflammation in cases with 
      covid infection, this study was designed to evaluate the value of ferritin in 
      cases with postcovid telogen effluvium one hundred patients recovering from covid 
      19 for 4-12 weeks were included in the study, detailed drug and laboratory 
      history was obtained and serum ferritin level was measured. the mean serum level 
      of ferritin among telogen effluvium patients was significantly lower than 
      controls (68.52 ± 126 and 137 ± 137.597 ug/L respectively). Patients with telogen 
      effluvium used significantly more azithromycin and ivermectin and significantly 
      less vitamin C, D, lactoferrin and zinc than the controls Although serum ferritin 
      is lower among telogen effluvium patients, it was still higher than the cutoff 
      value for diagnosing nonanemic iron deficiency, we suggest that it will not be a 
      good biomarkers in these cases. Our secondary outcomes showed that dietary 
      supplements used during active infection such as vitamin C, D, lactoferrin and 
      zinc might have a preventive value on postcovid hair loss, while azithromycin and 
      ivermectin could have a negative long term effect on telogen effluvium.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Plants and fungi have a long tradition in 
      ethnopharmacology for the treatment of infectious diseases including viruses. 
      Many of these natural products have also been used to combat SARS-CoV-2 
      infections or symptoms of the post- and long-COVID form, owing to the scarcity of 
      clinically approved therapeutics. AIM OF THE STUDY: The ongoing threat posed by 
      SARS-CoV-2, along with the rapidly evolving new variants, requires the 
      development of new antiviral compounds. The aim of this study was to identify 
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 herbal and fungal extracts used in traditional medicine against 
      acute respiratory infection, inflammation, and related symptoms. Additionally, we 
      sought to characterize their bioactive constituents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      antiviral activity and cell cytotoxicity of 179 herbal and fungal extracts were 
      evaluated using two SARS-CoV-2 infection assays in Caco-2 cells. 19 plant 
      extracts with and without anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity underwent detailed 
      dereplication using molecular networking. RESULTS: Extracts from Angelica 
      sinensis (Oliv.) Diels roots, Annona squamosa L. seeds, Azadirachta indica A. 
      Juss. fruits, Buddleja officinalis Maxim. flowers, Burkea africana Hook. bark and 
      Clinopodium menthifolium (Host) Stace aerial parts showed a potent anti 
      SARS-CoV-2 activity (IC(50) < 5 μg/ml) with only moderate cytotoxicity 
      (CC(50) > 60 μg/ml, Caco-2). By performing the dereplication with a 
      bioactivity-featured molecular network (MN) on the extract library level, rather 
      than on the level of individual extracts, we could pinpoint compounds 
      characteristic for active extracts. Thus, a straight-forward identification of 
      potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 natural compounds was achieved prior to any 
      fractionation or isolation efforts. CONCLUSIONS: A sophisticated hyphenation of 
      empirical knowledge with MS-based bioinformatics and automated compound 
      annotation was applied to decipher the chemical space of the investigated 
      extracts. The correlation with experimentally assessed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities 
      helped in predicting compound classes and structural elements relevant for the 
      antiviral activities. Consequently, this accelerated the identification of 
      constituents from the investigated mixtures with inhibitory effects against 
      SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Patients undergoing kidney transplant are at risk of severe COVID-19. Our 
      single-center retrospective analysis evaluated the outcomes of kidney transplant 
      outpatients with COVID-19 who were managed with reduced immunosuppression and 
      treatment with molnupiravir. Between January 2022 and May 2023, we included 93 
      patients (62 men, average age 56 years), serum creatinine 127 (101-153) µmol/L. 
      Molnupiravir was administered, and immunosuppressive therapy was reduced 
      immediately following the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR, which was 
      2 (1-3) days after the onset of symptoms. Only three (3.2%) patients required 
      hospitalization, and one patient died. Acute kidney injury was observed in two 
      patients. During the follow-up period of 19 (15-22) months, there was no 
      significant increase in proteinuria, no acute or new chronic graft rejection, and 
      kidney graft function remained stable; serum creatinine was 124 (106-159) µmol/L 
      post-COVID-19 infection and 128 (101-161) µmol/L at the end of the follow-up 
      period. Our results demonstrate that early initiation of molnupiravir treatment 
      combined with a temporary reduction in immunosuppressive therapy results in 
      favorable clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, with preservation of good 
      graft function and no episodes of graft rejection.

TI  - The roles of placental senescence, autophagy and senotherapeutics in the

AB  - Cellular senescence is a well-established biological phenomenon in eukaryotes. It 
      involves DNA damage, telomere shortening, a senescence-associated secretory 
      phenotype (SASP), and the inability of cells to replicate. It is associated with 
      ageing, and also with oxidative stress. Given the importance of oxidative stress 
      in pre-eclampsia, there is considerable evidence, that we review, that senescence 
      plays an important role in both normal placental development and in the 
      development of both early- and late-term pre-eclampsia. Autophagy is capable of 
      delaying or even reversing the development of senescence, and certain small 
      molecules such as sulforaphane and spermidine can stimulate autophagy, including 
      via the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2. Ergothioneine is a 
      thiohistidine antioxidant that is protective against a variety of cardiovascular 
      and other diseases. Ergothioneine also interacts with Nrf2, and pre-eclampsia 
      occurs far less frequently in individuals with higher plasma ergothioneine 
      levels. Together, these elements provide a self-consistent, molecular and systems 
      biology explanation for at least one mechanism by which ergothioneine may be 
      protective against pre-eclampsia.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global challenge now with the long-COVID arising. 
      Mitigation measures focused on case counting, assessment and determination of 
      variants and their likely targets of infection and transmission, the pursuit of 
      drug treatments, use and enhancement of masks, social distancing, vaccination, 
      post-infection rehabilitation, and mass screening. The latter is of utmost 
      importance given the current scenario of infections, reinfections, and long-term 
      health effects. Research on screening platforms has been developed to provide 
      more sensitive, specific, and reliable tests that are accessible to the entire 
      population and can be used to assess the prognosis of the disease as well as the 
      subsequent health follow-up of patients with sequelae of COVID-19. Therefore, the 
      aim of the present study was the simulation of exhaled breath of COVID-19 
      patients by evaluation of three identified COVID-19 indicator breath biomarkers 
      (acetone (ACE), acetaldehyde (ACH) and nitric oxide (NO)) by gas-phase infrared 
      spectroscopy as a proof-of-concept principle for the detection of infected 
      patients' exhaled breath fingerprint and subsequent follow-up. The specific 
      fingerprints of each of the compounds and the overall fingerprint were obtained. 
      The synthetic exhaled breath evaluation concept revealed a linearity of r = 0.99 
      for all compounds, and LODs of 6.42, 13.81, 9.22 ppm, and LOQs of 42.26, 52.57, 
      69.23 ppm for NO, ACE, and ACH, respectively. This study proves the fundamental 
      feasibility of gas-phase infrared spectroscopy for fingerprinting lung damage 
      biomarkers in exhaled breath of patients with COVID-19. This analysis would allow 
      faster and cheaper screening and follow-up of infected individuals, which could 
      improve mass screening in POC settings.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has adversely affected working 
      life all over the world, and the employees with the highest risk of transmission 
      have been those in the health sector. Since there are currently no effective 
      treatments for COVID-19, there have been numerous attempts to find alternative 
      treatments for both the spread of the infection and its treatment. These efforts 
      have included the use of herbal extracts to boost immunity and reduce the 
      likelihood of contracting the infection. This study explored the attitudes of 
      healthcare workers toward the consumption of COVID-19 herbal medicine (HM) 
      products. This is an online, cross-sectional observational study. In total, 1335 
      participants were reached. It was observed that 722 (54%) of them preferred 
      herbal treatments during the pandemic period. The attitudes of HM toward 327 
      (45.3%) healthcare workers and 395 (54.7%) general population participants were 
      examined. Both groups had high rates of use of HM as a COVID-19 preventive 
      measure (68.8 percent and 67.1 percent, respectively). While its use was higher 
      among healthcare workers during infection (OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.32-3.03), its use 
      was higher in the non-healthcare group for post-COVID problems (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 
      0.35-0.74). The opinion of healthcare professionals was that HM was more 
      efficient (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.19-21.15). All participants' main incentive to 
      utilize HM was family advice (n = 194, 26.9%). A total of 90 (12.4%) participants 
      reported side effects. Vomiting-nausea were the most typical adverse effects 
      (38.9%). The herb most frequently utilized was ginger (54%). Healthcare workers 
      use HM at rates that are the same as those of the general population. Both its 
      use during infections and the idea that it is effective are more common among 
      healthcare professionals than in the general population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The substantial burden of post-COVID-19 condition (also known as long 
      COVID) underscores the need for effective pharmacological interventions. Given 
      that viral persistence has been hypothesised as a potential cause of long COVID, 
      antiviral therapy might offer a promising approach to alleviating long COVID 
      symptoms. We therefore investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for treating long COVID. METHODS: In this phase 2, 
      decentralised, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, adults (aged ≥18 years) 
      from the 48 states across the contiguous USA, with previous documented SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and long COVID symptoms starting within 4 weeks of initial infection 
      and persisting for at least 12 weeks, were eligible for inclusion. Key exclusion 
      criteria were use of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within the previous 2 months, 
      CYP3A4-dependent medications, or strong CYP3A4 inducers; acute medical illness 
      such as SARS-CoV-2 infection within the past 2 weeks; active liver disease; renal 
      impairment; and immunocompromise. Using software for 1:1 stratified block random 
      assignment, participants were randomly allocated to receive either two tablets of 
      nirmatrelvir (150 mg each) and one tablet of ritonavir (100 mg), or placebo and 
      one tablet of ritonavir (100 mg), orally administered twice daily for 15 days, 
      stratified by age, sex at birth, and COVID-19 vaccination status. Participants, 
      clinicians, and the study team were masked to treatment allocation. The primary 
      efficacy endpoint was the change in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS)-29 Physical Health Summary Score (PHSS) from baseline 
      to day 28, analysed by intention to treat. Safety endpoints were reported from 
      baseline to week 6 in all participants who were exposed to the study treatment. 
      This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05668091) and is now closed 
      to new participants. FINDINGS: Between April 14, 2023, and Feb 26, 2024, 119 
      participants were screened. 100 were enrolled (66 [66%] female participants and 
      34 [34%] male participants), with 49 assigned to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group 
      and 51 to the placebo-ritonavir group (intention-to-treat population). Three 
      participants in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and two in the placebo-ritonavir 
      group withdrew before starting treatment and were excluded from the safety 
      population. The mean PROMIS-29 PHSS at baseline was 39·6 (95% CI 37·4 to 41·9) in 
      the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and 36·3 (34·4 to 38·2) in the placebo-ritonavir 
      group. The adjusted change from baseline to day 28 was 0·45 (-0·93 to 1·83) in 
      the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and 1·01 (-0·30 to 2·31) in the 
      placebo-ritonavir group (adjusted mean difference -0·55 [95% CI -2·32 to 1·21; 
      p=0·54]). No deaths or serious adverse events were recorded between baseline and 
      week 6. Study drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 
      more participants in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group (35 [76%] of 46) compared 
      with the placebo-ritonavir group (27 [55%] of 49), mostly driven by dysgeusia. 
      Early treatment termination due to an adverse event occurred in two participants 
      in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and one in the placebo-ritonavir group. 
      INTERPRETATION: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir administered for 15 days did not 
      significantly improve health outcomes in participants with long COVID compared 
      with placebo-ritonavir at day 28. However, the study showed the feasibility of 
      large-scale, decentralised trials in long COVID. FUNDING: Pfizer, Fred Cohen, and 
      Carolyn Klebanoff.

TI  - Early Administration of Bosentan in High-Risk COVID-19 Outpatients at Risk of 
      Sarcopenia: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.
PG  - e13753

LID - e13753
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial damage induces myofibrillar breakdown and muscle 
      degradation in COVID-19 infection. There is a relationship between increased 
      endothelin-1 synthesis and sarcopenia. We evaluated the preventive effect of 
      early bosentan therapy as an endothelin receptor blocker in sarcopenia in 
      high-risk outpatients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: From 15 December 2021 to 
      15 August 2023, patients within 3 days of the onset of signs and symptoms were 
      randomly assigned to receive bosentan, 62.5 mg, or placebo, twice daily from 
      enrollment for 30 days. The primary outcome was disease progression (death or 
      hospitalization within 15 days after randomization), and the data for this 
      outcome have been previously published. Sarcopenia as a secondary outcome was 
      assessed prospectively at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after randomization using the 
      criteria of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019 (IRCT.ir, 
      IRCT20211203053263N1). RESULTS: A total of 313 patients (156 bosentan group, 157 
      controls) were included in the analyses, which were performed under the 
      intent-to-treat principle. Overall, the incidence of sarcopenia was 8.6% 
      (n = 27). Nineteen (73%) had severe sarcopenia. At the 3-month follow-up, the 
      incidence of sarcopenia was 8.3% in the total population, with the significant 
      risk difference (RD) of -10.17% in the bosentan group versus the control group. 
      The incidence in the total population and RD in the bosentan group versus the 
      control group at months 6, 9 and 12 were 8.6% (RD: -10.81%, p < 0.001), 8.3% (RD: 
      -10.17%, p = 0.001) and 5.4% (RD: -6.99%, p = 0.003), respectively. During the 
      study, 29 people developed severe COVID-19 and were hospitalized. At follow-up, 
      sarcopenia occurred in four inpatients and 23 outpatients (p = 0.23). Mortality 
      occurred in 5.1% (n = 16) of the total population, including 4 (1.3%) of the 
      patients in the bosentan group and 12 (3.8%) of the patients in the placebo group 
      (p = 0.069). None of the patients who died had sarcopenia. Bosentan did not cause 
      any severe adverse events and was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Early 
      administration of bosentan may prevent sarcopenia in high-risk outpatients with 
      COVID-19.

AB  - Demand for high quality Basmati rice has increased significantly in the last 
      decade. This commodity is highly vulnerable to fraud, especially in the post 
      COVID-19 era. A unique two-tiered analytical system comprised of rapid on-site 
      screening of samples using handheld portable Near-infrared NIR and laboratory 
      confirmatory technique using a Head space gas chromatography mass spectrometry 
      (HS-GC-MS) strategy for untargeted analysis was developed. Chemometric models 
      built using NIR data correctly predicted nearly 100% of Pusa 1121 and Taraori, 
      two high value types of Basmati, from potential adulterants. Furthermore, rice 
      VOC profile fingerprints showed very good classification (R2 >0.9, Q2 > 0.9, 
      Accuracy > 0.99) for these high quality Basmati varieties from potential 
      adulterant varieties with aldehydes identified as key VOC marker compounds. Using 
      a two-tiered system of a rapid method for on-site screening of many samples 
      alongside a laboratory-based confirmatory method can classify Basmati rice 
      varieties, protecting the supply chain from fraud.

AB  - Since the emergence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, 
      significant advancements has been made in research, from limited knowledge about 
      the disease to the development of a vaccine. Although the severity of Severe 
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) appears to be decreasing 
      and the threat of COVID-19 is waning, there have been widespread concerns about 
      persistent symptoms or sequelae experienced by some patients even after 
      recovering from COVID-19. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has shown favorable 
      treatment outcomes during the onset of COVID-19, and extensive studies have been 
      carried out to explore the efficacy of TCM interventions during the COVID-19 
      recovery period. The purpose of this review is to comprehensively analyze these 
      studies and provide new insights for the prevention and treatment of the 
      post-COVID-19 condition.

TI  - A Potential Therapeutic Approach According to Traditional Thai Medicine Theory 
      for Post-COVID-19 Syndrome Treatment: An Observational Retrospective Clinical 
      Study.
PG  - 42-49
LID - AT7931 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most post-COVID-19 patients had physiological health problems, which 
      differed for each patient. The potential treatment for post-COVID-19 syndrome 
      must require multi-disciplinary approaches that focus on individualized 
      treatment. Therefore, traditional Thai Medicine (TTM) clinical practice 
      guidelines for post-COVID-19 treatment are developed by the Traditional Thai 
      Medicine Hospital, Prince of Songkla University, to care for post-COVID-19 
      patients. OBJECTIVE: This current study aimed to investigate the effect of the 
      guidelines on post-COVID-19 patient's physical health. METHODS: This research was 
      a retrospective clinical study, carried out from June 2022 to July 2022. SETTING: 
      The study was conducted at the Traditional Thai Medicine Hospital, Prince of 
      Songkla University, and La Flora Khao Lak TTM clinic, Thailand. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Data (n=17) were collected from the medical record. They were included if they 
      met the following criteria: patients were more than 18 years old, had a medical 
      history of COVID-19 disease, had fully recovered from the disease (ATK for 
      COVID-19 is negative) at least a week before starting the guideline, and had 
      complete medical information such as post-COVID-19 symptoms, vital signs, pain 
      score, cough severity score, and quality of life examination. INTERVENTION: 
      Approaches for post-COVID-19 treatment included herbal Thai medicine recipes, 
      Thai massage, herbal steam inhalation, herbal hot steam, herbal hot water 
      immersion, acupressure massage for breathing stimulation, and a breathing 
      exercise. All procedures were applied for 7 days continually or until they have 
      recovered. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The effects of TTM approaches on the 
      symptoms of post-COVID-19 patients on pain score, quality of life, cough severity 
      were measured using a visual analog score (VAS), SF-36 questionnaire, and cough 
      severity index (CSI), respectively. RESULTS: The average duration time of 
      post-COVID-19 syndrome was 25.76 days, and the most common symptom was muscle 
      pain/stress (10; 71.43%). Yahom-Navakot (6; 42.86%) is the most common recipe 
      used for the treatment. Interestingly, the pain score was significantly reduced 
      by 3 days of the treatment (4.88±2.03 vs 2.29±2.08 ). Moreover, the cough 
      severity index (12.86±11.55 vs 3.31±6.38) was significantly lessened by 7 days of 
      the treatment. Remarkably, most symptoms vanished entirely after 7 days of the 
      intervention, leading to a better quality of life for the patients (53.24±22.15 
      vs 65.59±23.64). CONCLUSIONS: The TTM clinical practice guideline for treating 
      post-COVID-19 syndrome effectively improved the overall physical health capacity 
      and symptoms associated with post-COVID-19 syndrome. Therefore, the 
      implementation of this guideline, together with other approaches, could 
      strengthen the treatment for post-COVID-19 to be more effective.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies, but not all, have suggested a positive effect of 
      allopurinol on the cardiovascular system. The randomised, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of allopurinol on the risk of 
      cardiovascular events in patients with high and very high cardiovascular risk, 
      including the presence of long-COVID-19 syndrome (ALL-VASCOR) study aims to 
      evaluate the efficacy of allopurinol therapy for improving cardiovascular 
      outcomes in patients at high and very high cardiovascular risk excluding 
      ischaemic heart disease. This is particularly important due to the high cost of 
      cardiovascular disease treatment and its status as one of the leading causes of 
      mortality. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The ALL-VASCOR study is a randomised, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial that examines the effect of 
      allopurinol therapy (200-500 mg of allopurinol daily) versus an equivalent dose 
      of placebo on the risk of cardiovascular events in 1116 patients aged 40-70 with 
      serum uric acid levels above 5 mg/dL at high and very high risk of cardiovascular 
      disease. The ALL-VASCOR study will also assess the occurrence of long-COVID-19 
      syndrome. The study will measure primary and secondary as well as additional 
      endpoints and the planned intervention will end on 31 July 2028 unless advised 
      otherwise by the Safe Monitoring Board or other applicable authorities. 
      Participant recruitment is planned to begin in March 2024 in Poland. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: The study was ethically approved by the Bioethics Committee of 
      Poznan University of Medical Sciences (No 03/23, 12 January 2023). The results 
      are expected after 2028 and will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at 
      international conferences. PROTOCOL VERSION NUMBER: 01-15 November 2022. TRIAL

AB  - BACKGROUND: Post COVID-19 condition (PCC) is a complication of SARS-COV-2 
      infection and can lead to long-term disability. METHODS: The present study was 
      designed to analyse the gene expression patterns of PCC through bulk RNA 
      sequencing of whole blood and to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of 
      PCC. Whole blood was collected from 80 participants enrolled in a prospective 
      cohort study following SARS-CoV-2 infected and non-infected individuals for 
      6 months after recruitment and was used for bulk RNA sequencing. Identification 
      of differentially expressed genes (DEG), pathway enrichment and immune cell 
      deconvolution was performed to explore potential biological pathways involved in 
      PCC. RESULTS: We have found 13 differentially expressed genes associated with 
      PCC. Enriched pathways were related to interferon-signalling and anti-viral 
      immune processes. CONCLUSION: The PCC transcriptome is characterized by a modest 
      overexpression of interferon-stimulated genes, pointing to a subtle ongoing 
      inflammatory response.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 escalated inappropriate antibiotic use. We determined the 
      distribution of pathogens causing community-acquired co-infections, the rate, and 
      factors associated with early empiric antibiotic (EEAB) treatment among 
      hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The Society of Critical Care Medicine 
      Discovery Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study (VIRUS) 
      COVID-19 Registry including 68,428 patients from 28 countries enrolled between 
      January 2020 and October 2021 were screened. After exclusions, 7830 patients were 
      included in the analysis. Azithromycin and/or other antibiotic treatment given 
      within the first 3 days of hospitalization was investigated. Univariate and 
      multivariate analyses were performed to determine factors associated with EEAB 
      use. RESULTS: The majority (6214, 79.4%) of patients received EEAB, with 
      azithromycin combination being the most frequent (3146, 40.2%). As the pandemic 
      advanced, the proportion of patients receiving EEAB regressed from 84.4% 
      (786/931) in January-March 2020 to 65.2% (30/46) in April-June 2021 (P < 0.001). 
      Beta-lactams, especially ceftriaxone was the most commonly used antibiotic. 
      Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated pathogen. Multivariate 
      analysis showed geographical location and pandemic timeline as the strongest 
      independent predictors of EEAB use. CONCLUSIONS: EEAB administration decreased as 
      pandemic advanced, which may be the result of intensified antimicrobial 
      stewardship efforts. Our study provides worldwide goals for antimicrobial 
      stewardship programs in the post-COVID-19 era.

      and 18 years with COVID-19 between January 1, 2022 and August 31, 2023. The 
      propensity score matching (PSM) method was used to match patients receiving NMV-r 
      (NMV-r group) with those who did not receive NMV-r (control group). Two cohorts 
      comprising 633 patients each (NMV-r and control groups), with balanced baseline 
      characteristics, were identified using the PSM method. During the initial 30 
      days, the NMV-r group showed a lower incidence of all-cause hospitalization, 
      mortality, or ED visits (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.546, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
      0.372-0.799, p = 0.002). Additionally, the NMV-r group had a significantly lower 
      risk of all-cause hospitalization compared with the control group (HR = 0.463, 
      95% CI: 0.269-0.798), with no deaths occurring in either group. In the 30-180-day 
      follow-up period, the NMV-r group exhibited a non-significantly lower incidence 
      of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), encompassing symptoms such 
      as fatigue, cardiopulmonary symptoms, pain, cognitive impairments, headache, 
      dizziness, sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression, compared to the control 
      group. This study underscores the potential effectiveness of NMV-r in treating 
      high-risk pediatric patients with COVID-19, demonstrating significant reductions 
      in short-term adverse outcomes such as emergency department visits, 
      hospitalization, or mortality within the initial 30-day period. Additionally, 
      NMV-r shows promise in potentially preventing the development of PASC.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 typically causes mild symptoms in children, but evidence suggests that 
      persistent immunopathological changes may lead to long COVID (LC). To explore the 
      interplay between LC and innate immunity, we assessed the type I interferon 
      (IFN-I) response in children and adolescents with LC symptoms (LC; n = 28). This 
      was compared with age-matched SARS-CoV-2 recovered participants without LC 
      symptoms (MC; n = 28) and healthy controls (HC; n = 18). We measured the mRNA 
      expression of IFN-I (IFN-α/β/ε/ω), IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1/2), and ISGs (ISG15, 
      ISG56, MxA, IFI27, BST2, LY6E, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and MDA5) in PBMCs collected 3-6 
      months after COVID-19. LC adolescents (12-17 years) had higher transcript levels 
      of IFN-β, IFN-ε, and IFN-ω than HC, whereas LC children (6-11 years) had lower 
      levels than HC. In adolescents, increased levels of IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-ω mRNAs 
      were found in the LC group compared with MC, while lower levels were observed in 
      LC children than MC. Adolescents with neurological symptoms had higher IFN-α/β 
      mRNA levels than MC. LC and MC participants showed decreased expression of ISGs 
      and IFNAR1, but increased expression of IFNAR2, than HC. Our results show 
      age-related changes in the expression of transcripts involved in the IFN-I 
      signaling pathway in children and adolescents with LC.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is associated with a broad spectrum of bacterial and 
      fungal superinfections. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of mucormycosis 
      developing during post-COVID-19 therapeutic management. A 63-year-old diabetic 
      female presented with COVID-19 and received combination therapy per institutional 
      protocol, including dexamethasone, remdesivir, and ivermectin. Seven days 
      post-discharge, the patient was readmitted with dyspnea and lethargy. On day 3 of 
      readmission, the patient reported unilateral facial and orbital pain. Subsequent 
      histopathological and mycological examination confirmed mucormycosis. Despite 
      surgical debridement and treatment with amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/day), the patient 
      succumbed to the infection. RESULTS: Based on ITS rDNA sequencing, the fungus was 
      identified as Rhizopus arrhizus. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed 
      according to the CLSI M38-A2 guideline, yielding minimum inhibitory concentration 
      (MIC) values of 0.016 µg/mL for amphotericin B, 0.031 µg/mL for posaconazole, 
      0.25 µg/mL for isavuconazole, 1 µg/mL for itraconazole, and 8 µg/mL for 
      voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis, prompt antifungal therapy, and 
      appropriate surgical intervention are critical for improving mucormycosis 
      outcomes, especially in COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Post-COVID-19 approach to teaching an undergraduate laboratory class focused on 
      experimental design and data interpretation.
PG  - 442-452
LID - 10.1002/bmb.21833 [doi]
AB  - To best prepare students for the real-world research environment, key skills, 
      including experimental design, data analysis, communication of results, and 
      critical thinking, should be key components of undergraduate science courses. 
      Furthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on in-person teaching has 
      resulted in a need to develop courses that enable flexible learning. This paper 
      details the laboratory component of a senior-level toxicology class that was 
      developed to emphasize all these skills and allow for flexible learning. The aim 
      of the laboratory class was for students to determine how curcumin protected 
      against acetaminophen-induced hepatoxicity. To stimulate critical thinking, 
      students were required to choose a maximum of four experiments from the six on 
      offer. Before conducting an experiment, students stated a hypothesis and selected 
      the appropriate treatment groups. Once an experiment was completed, students were 
      given access to a complete dataset, on which they performed statistical analysis 
      and drew conclusions. Students who were unable to attend the laboratory session 
      in person were able to complete the required pre-lab work and access the dataset. 
      Following each experiment, students could write a lab summary, and receive 
      thorough feedback. The final assessment was a written manuscript of their 
      findings as well as a chance to respond to reviewer comments. This teaching 
      approach prioritized the critical thinking, analysis, and experimental design 
      aspects of scientific research. Overall, this structure was well received by 
      students and it could easily be adapted for use on other life science courses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited research exists on the features and management of post-COVID 
      cough. This real-world study investigates outpatients with subacute or chronic 
      post-COVID cough, aiming to delineate characteristics and regimen responses 
      within the population. METHOD: We enrolled eligible patients from our outpatient 
      unit between August 2023 and February 2024. Comprehensive clinical data, 
      prescriptions, and patient-reported cough severity were collected during the 
      primary visit and subsequent follow-ups. RESULT: A total of 141 patients, aged: 
      42 ± 14 years old, were included, with 70% being female. The median cough 
      duration was 8 weeks (interquartile range 4-12 weeks). Sixty percent presented 
      with a dry cough, while the rest had coughs with phlegm. Over half reported 
      abnormal laryngeal sensations (54%). Twenty-one percent coughed during the day, 
      while 32% coughed constantly, and 48% experienced nocturnal episodes. Compound 
      methoxyphenamine capsules were the most prescribed, but our study found ICS/LABA 
      to be the most effective, followed by compound methoxyphenamine capsules, 
      montelukast, and Chinese patent drugs. CONCLUSION: Females exhibit a higher 
      prevalence of post-COVID cough, and our study recommends ICS/LABA as the 
      preferred treatment. These findings warrant validation through larger, 
      prospectively designed studies.

TI  - Post-COVID Syndrome in Southern Tunisia: Prevalence, Clinical Spectrum, and 
      Associated Factors Among Non-Severe Patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Post-COVID syndrome, a long-term consequence of the COVID-19 
      pandemic, remains insufficiently understood. This study aimed to estimate the 
      prevalence of post-COVID syndrome, describe its clinical spectrum, and identify 
      associated factors among patients with non-severe forms of the disease. METHODS: 
      We conducted a cross-sectional study using telephone interviews in Sfax, southern 
      Tunisia, during January 2021. The study population included individuals who 
      tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in October 2020. Minors and deceased individuals 
      were excluded. Post-COVID syndrome was defined as the persistence of symptoms for 
      more than eight weeks following the initial COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: A total 
      of 2,070 patients were enrolled. The sample included 1,230 women (59.4%), with a 
      male-to-female ratio of 0.68. The median age was 40 years [semi-interquartile 
      range (SIR): 12.5 years]. The prevalence of post-COVID syndrome was 41.6% 
      (n = 861). Among these, 229 patients (26.5%) consulted a physician for persistent 
      symptoms, and 122 (14.13%) underwent further paraclinical evaluation. The most 
      commonly reported symptoms were ageusia (68.9%), cognitive difficulties including 
      concentration and memory impairment (24.9%), and fatigue (17.4%). Independent 
      factors significantly associated with post-COVID syndrome included: age under 
      60 years (AOR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.50-2.66), female gender (AOR = 1.6; 95% CI: 
      1.35-1.96), history of chronic respiratory disease (AOR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2-2.8), 
      history of cancer (AOR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.03-12.2), anticoagulant therapy (AOR = 
      1.45; 95% CI: 1.1-1.8), salicylic acid use (AOR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.9), and 
      initial clinical severity categorized as mild (AOR = 5.5; 95% CI: 3.5-8.5) or 
      moderate (AOR = 7.1; 95% CI: 4.2-11.9). CONCLUSION: A better understanding of the 
      long-term manifestations of COVID-19, such as post-COVID syndrome, is essential. 
      In the context of widespread vaccination and evolving variants, multidisciplinary 
      approaches must be reconsidered to improve patient follow-up and healthcare 
      strategies.

TI  - Association of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir and the Risk of Long COVID Among US Adults: 
      A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - e70494
LID - 10.1002/jmv.70494 [doi]
AB  - Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMV-r) is an oral antiviral agent authorized for treating 
      acute COVID-19, but its effectiveness in reducing long COVID risk remains 
      uncertain. This multicenter retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the 
      association between NMV-r and the risk of long COVID. Electronic health record 
      data from the TriNetX US Collaborative Network were used. Adults aged ≥ 18 years 
      with a positive COVID-19 test between January 1, 2022 and June 30, 2024 were 
      included. NMV-r users were those who received NMV-r within 5 days of testing 
      positive, while those who did not receive NMV-r within this period were the 
      nonusers. The outcome was time to the first diagnosis of incident post-COVID 
      conditions, including general, pulmonary, cardiac, thromboembolic, neurologic, 
      mental, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and kidney symptoms. Propensity score 
      matching was performed to balance baseline characteristics and Cox proportional 
      hazards models were used to estimate the risk of long COVID between NMV-r users 
      and nonusers. Both groups included 218 825 patients after matching. Overall, the 
      risk of long COVID was similar between NMV-r users and nonusers (HR, 0.99; 95% 
      CI, 0.98-1.01). Symptom-specific analyses revealed mixed effects, with NMV-r use 
      associated with an increased risk of cough and sleeping disorders but a decreased 
      risk for other long COVID symptoms. Sensitivity analyses showed consistent 
      results with the main analysis. In conclusion, NMV-r use was not associated with 
      a reduced risk of long COVID. Future research is needed to explore its 
      heterogeneous effects on post-COVID conditions.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial comparing mindfulness to escitalopram for anxiety: 
      In-person and remote, synchronous delivery pre and post COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the pandemic, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) versus the antidepressant, escitalopram 
      (ESC) added a second phase using a synchronous, videoconference (VC) format for 
      both interventions, enabling randomized and naturalistic comparisons. The 
      original in-person RCT demonstrated non-inferiority of MBSR to ESC. In the second 
      phase, we hypothesized that MBSR-VC would be non-inferior to ESC-VC, and that 
      MBSR-VC would be non-inferior to in-person MBSR (MBSR-IN). METHODS: Adults with 
      anxiety disorders were recruited for a 3-center RCT. Primary (Clinical Global 
      Impression of Severity: CGIS) and secondary outcomes (satisfaction, other 
      measures for anxiety subtypes) were compared between MBSR-IN vs MBSR-VC, ESC-IN 
      vs ESC-VC and MBSR-VC vs ESC-VC. RESULTS: MBSR-VC (n = 100) and ESC-VC (n = 102) 
      did not significantly differ in mean CGI-S change at endpoint (1.39 vs 1.51, 
      p = 0.17) but non-inferiority of MBSR-VC was not supported. MBSR did not vary by 
      delivery format (VC: 1.3 vs. IN: 1.3, p = 0.77) and MBSR-VC's non-inferiority to 
      MBSR-IN was demonstrated within the pre-specified margin of -0.40 (95 % CI: -0.34 
      to 0.25). ESC-IN and ESC-VC were not significantly different in CGI-S change in 
      unadjusted comparisons (1.4 vs 1.5, p = 0.53), but the average CGI-S at endpoint 
      was significantly lower in the ESC-VC group in a multivariable longitudinal 
      model. Other findings included in-person treatments having a greater impact on 
      social anxiety compared to their VC version, ESC-VC having higher satisfaction 
      ratings and a greater impact on panic symptoms than MBSR-VC. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Remotely delivered MBSR demonstrated comparable effectiveness to in-person MBSR 
      for anxiety disorders, providing support for this delivery approach. Social 
      anxiety symptoms improved more with in-person care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03522844.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to neuropsychiatric sequelae. 
      Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective amide 
      used in depressive syndromes. Here we investigate whether 
      micronized/ultramicronized (m/um) PEA improves neuropsychiatric sequelae in 
      COVID-19 survivors. Patients evaluated at our post-COVID-19 outpatient clinic 
      between February and August 2021 and presenting neuropsychiatric manifestations ( 
      n  = 98) were offered treatment with m/umPEA 600 mg twice daily for 3 months. 
      Those accepting m/umPEA therapy ( n  = 57) were compared with those who did not ( 
      n  = 41), in terms of depression, fatigue, chronic pain and subjective 
      well-being, through validated scales administered pre- and posttreatment. The two 
      groups did not differ in terms of demographics, comorbidities, psychiatric 
      history, antidepressant therapy, acute COVID-19 severity and baseline 
      neuropsychiatric status. Patients receiving m/umPEA showed a greater improvement 
      in depression and fatigue (both P  < 0.05). Conversely, no association was found 
      with changes in chronic pain or subjective well-being. At multivariable logistic 
      regression, m/umPEA predicted neuropsychiatric improvement independently of age, 
      sex and baseline neuropsychiatric status. Worse pretreatment fatigue and 
      subjective well-being identified those who most likely benefited from treatment. 
      In conclusion, despite its retrospective nature, our study suggests that m/umPEA 
      may improve depression and fatigue in COVID-19 survivors, justifying future 
      research in this setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neoscytalidiumdimidiatum is an opportunistic dematiaceous fungus 
      belonging to the class Dothideomycetes. CASE REPORT: We report a case of N. 
      dimidiatum cerebral phaeohyphomycosis post COVID-19 infection in a 32-year-old 
      male from Iran. The causative agent was identified by cytopathology, routine 
      mycological methods, and DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 
      region of rDNA. Apart from COVID-19 complications and the corticosteroid therapy, 
      no underlying condition was diagnosed. The symptoms suggesting the fungal 
      infection were shown two weeks after being discharged from COVID-19 hospital 
      stay. Magnetic resonance of the brain showed a multi-focal central nervous system 
      infection. The delayed identification of the fungus and, thus, a late starting of 
      the antifungal treatment with amphotericin B, might have affected the patient 
      outcome as he finally died. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the rare incidence of N. 
      dimidiatum infections, this case should aware us about them, leading to a timely 
      antifungal management.

AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) bloodstream infections (BSIs) are severe, 
      life-threatening events. PA success involves a complex interplay between 
      virulence, antimicrobial resistance and epidemicity. This study examines the 
      impact of COVID-19 pandemic on PA-BSI characteristics. Seventy-eight bacteraemic 
      PA isolates were collected in two periods: pre-COVID 2015-2018 (48 PA) and 
      post-COVID 2022-2023 (30 PA). An increase in non-susceptibility rates was found 
      in post-COVID period, noteworthy for gentamicin, netilmicin and 
      multidrug-resistance, although extensively drug resistant/difficult-to-treat 
      (XDR/DTR) isolates were only detected in pre-COVID period. All isolates were 
      cefiderocol-susceptible, but resistance to novel cephalosporin-inhibitor 
      combinations and colistin was identified in pre-COVID period. 
      Carbapenem-non-susceptible PA persisted around 20%, associated with OprD 
      alterations and one pre-COVID-isolate harboured bla(VIM-2). High clonal diversity 
      was found: 71 pulsotypes and 52 sequence types (most prevalent: ST17, ST244 and 
      ST274). A shift in serotypes was detected between pre-COVID-PA (O:1) and 
      post-COVID-PA (O:6). Eight virulotypes were detected, highlighting one 
      exlA-hypervirulent post-COVID-PA, and exoU(+)/exoS(-) genotype in 17% 
      pre-COVID-PA but none post-COVID-PA. Biofilm production was significantly higher 
      in pre-COVID-PA. This work shed light on the evolving nature of PA infections 
      amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, providing valuable insights for clinical management 
      and reinforcing the importance of judicious antibiotic use in the context of 
      public health crises.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While COVID-19 has been controlled and deaths have decreased, the 
      long-term consequences of COVID-19 remain a challenge we face today. This study 
      was conducted to determine the relationship between the apoptosis of lymphocyte 
      cells with DNA damage and oxidative stress and the therapeutic and clinical 
      outcomes of elderly patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This study was conducted 
      from April 2020 to May 2021 (the period of severe attacks of the epidemic peak of 
      COVID-19) and September 2022 (the post-COVID-19 period). The study groups 
      included elderly patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the ICU and normal wards 
      of the hospital as well as elderly patients with influenza. A polymerase chain 
      reaction was used to check the validity of the studied diseases. The Annexin 
      V/Propidium Iodide method was used to evaluate the level of apoptosis. Genotoxic 
      effects and DNA damage were assessed by the comet assay method. Total antioxidant 
      status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) were 
      measured by photometric methods. RESULTS: The highest level of apoptosis in 
      peripheral blood lymphocytes and the highest level of DNA damage were observed at 
      both times in the intubated-ICU and non-intubated-ICU groups. In all groups, 
      there was a significant increase in peripheral blood lymphocyte apoptosis levels 
      and DNA damage levels compared to the healthy control group (p < 0.01). The level 
      of apoptosis and DNA damage decreased significantly in the post-COVID-19 period 
      (p < 0.01). In the investigation of oxidative stress biomarkers, the oxidative 
      stress index, including TOS and MPO levels, increased in patients (p < 0.01), and 
      the TAS level decreased (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: It shows that the apoptosis of 
      lymphocyte cells, DNA damage, and oxidative stress can be effective in prognostic 
      decisions and is a suitable predictor for diagnosing the condition of patients 
      with viral infections such as COVID-19 and influenza.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causes hyperinflammation and 
      activation of coagulation cascade and, as a result, aggravates endothelial cell 
      dysfunction. N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide have been found to mitigate 
      endothelial damage. The influence on coronary artery endothelial cells of serum 
      collected after 4 ± 1 months from coronavirus infection was studied. The 
      concentrations of serum samples of interleukin 6, von Willebrand Factor, tissue 
      Plasminogen Activator, and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 were studied. The 
      cultures with serum of patients after coronavirus infection were incubated with 
      N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide to estimate their potential protective role. The 
      blood inflammatory parameters were increased in the group of cultures incubated 
      with serum from patients after coronavirus infection. Supplementation of the 
      serum from patients after coronavirus infection with N-acetylcysteine or 
      Sulodexide reduced the synthesis of interleukin 6 and von Willebrand Factor. No 
      changes in the synthesis of tissue Plasminogen Activator were observed. 
      N-acetylcysteine reduced the synthesis of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1. 
      N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide increased the tPA/PAI-1 ratio. N-acetylcysteine 
      may have a role in reducing the myocardial injury occurring in the post-COVID-19 
      syndrome. Sulodexide can also play a protective role in post-COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Pharmaceutical and Recreational Drug Usage Patterns during and Post COVID-19 
      Determined by Wastewater-Based Epidemiology.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph21020206 [doi]
LID - 206
AB  - Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) was applied to evaluate the consumption 
      trends of pharmaceuticals (i.e., antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs, antiepileptics, antihypertensives, and others), as well as recreational 
      drugs (caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine), in Latvia from December 2020 to July 
      2023. The time period covers both the COVID-19 pandemic and the post-pandemic 
      periods; therefore, the impact of the implemented restrictions and the 
      consequences of the illness in terms of the usage of pharmaceuticals thereon were 
      investigated. Additionally, the seasonality and impact of the seasonal flu and 
      other acute upper respiratory infections were studied. The results revealed that 
      the pandemic impacted the consumption of alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine, as well 
      as several pharmaceuticals, such as antihypertensives, antidepressants, 
      psychiatric drugs, and the painkiller ibuprofen. The findings suggest that the 
      imposed restrictions during the pandemic may have had a negative effect on the 
      population's health and mental well-being. Distinct seasonal trends were 
      discovered in the consumption patterns of caffeine and alcohol, where lower use 
      was observed during the summer. The seasonal consumption trends of 
      pharmaceuticals were discovered in the case of antibiotics, the antiasthmatic 
      drug salbutamol, and the decongestant xylometazoline, where higher consumption 
      occurred during colder seasons.

TI  - Randomized trial of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir versus placebo for adults with acute 
      COVID-19 to prevent long COVID: PanoramicNOR Trial.
PG  - 477
LID - 10.1186/s13063-025-09226-6 [doi]
LID - 477
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of long-term persisting symptoms after COVID-19 
      (coronavirus disease 2019), termed long COVID or post-COVID-19 condition, even 
      among those with mild initial disease, may have a large public health impact. 
      Apart from avoiding infection, there is no proven prevention or treatment for 
      long COVID. We will perform a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to 
      assess whether treatment with the novel antiviral, nirmatrelvir and ritonavir 
      (Paxlovid®) for acute COVID-19 can prevent the development of long COVID. 
      METHODS: This is a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial that aims 
      to recruit 2000 nonpregnant persons aged 18 to 64 years with acute COVID-19 with 
      positive PCR and/or antigen test and symptom duration of not more than 5 days. 
      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to a 5-day course of Paxlovid (two tablets 
      150-mg nirmatrelvir and one tablet 100-mg ritonavir twice daily) or a 5-day 
      course of placebo (similar number of tablets of equal appearance). The primary 
      endpoint will be persistent symptoms compatible with long COVID, assessed as the 
      prevalence of a dichotomous variable corresponding to the presence (1) or absence 
      (0) of one or more of the following symptoms: (i) fatigue, (ii) dyspnea, and 
      (iii) cognitive symptoms (memory and/or concentration problems). The primary 
      outcome will be evaluated at 3-month follow-up and then re-evaluated at 6, 12, 
      and 24 months. DISCUSSION: As more than 750 million people with confirmed 
      COVID-19 have survived globally, the potential burden of long COVID on societies 
      is formidable. If a simple 5-day oral treatment course with 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is shown to prevent long COVID, it would be a highly 
      attractive intervention at an individual level and a mitigation of its public 
      health consequences. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05852873.

      rapid response initiative in Rhode Island.

AB  - Despite its proven efficacy, buprenorphine remains dramatically underutilized for 
      management of opioid use disorder largely due to onerous barriers to treatment 
      initiation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many substance use disorder treatment 
      facilities have reduced their hours and services, exacerbating existing barriers. 
      To this end, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and Substance Abuse Mental 
      Health Services Administration adjusted their guidelines to allow for new 
      buprenorphine prescriptions following audio-only telehealth encounters, no longer 
      requiring an in-person evaluation prior to treatment initiation. Under this new 
      guidance, we established a 24/7 telephone hotline to function as a "tele-bridge" 
      clinic where people with opioid use disorder can be linked with a buprenorphine 
      prescriber in real-time for OUD assessment and unobserved buprenorphine 
      initiation with connection to follow-up if appropriate. Additionally, we 
      developed an ED callback protocol to reach patients recently seen for opioid 
      overdose and facilitate their entry into care if interested. In this commentary 
      we describe our hotline and ED callback protocols, discuss theoretical and 
      anecdotal benefits to this approach, and advocate for continuation of current 
      regulatory changes post-COVID-19 to maintain expanded access to novel treatment 
      approaches.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Concentrations of neopterin, kynurenine and kynurenine/tryptophan 
      ratios predict prognosis and the need for oxygen therapy in patients hospitalized 
      for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The 
      aims of the present study were to evaluate the changes of these biomarkers early 
      in the course of infection, the association with the prior coronavirus disease 
      (COVID-19) vaccination and therapeutic administration of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 
      monoclonal antibodies, investigation of other potential biomarkers including 
      neuropilin, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine and 8-hydroxyguanosine in patients 
      hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection and an assessment of these biomarkers and 
      vitamins A, E and D in patients with post-COVID syndrome. METHODS: Urine and 
      blood samples were obtained on the 1st to the 4th day and 4th to 7th day from 108 
      patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 
      methods were used to analyse neopterin, kynurenine, tryptophan, liposoluble 
      vitamins, and DNA damage biomarkers. RESULTS: A statistically significant 
      decrease of neopterin, kynurenine and kynurenine/tryptophan ratios was observed 
      on after 4th to 7th day of hospitalization, and concentrations of these 
      biomarkers were increased in patients with poor prognosis and subsequent 
      post-COVID syndrome. The concentrations of remaining biomarker and vitamins were 
      not associated with outcomes, although markedly decreased concentrations of 
      vitamin A, E and D were noted. CONCLUSIONS: The concentrations of neopterin, 
      kynurenine and kynurenine/tryptophan ratios decrease during the course of 
      infection SARS-CoV-2 and are associated with the post-COVID syndrome. No other 
      prognostic biomarkers were identified.

AB  - Qingjin Yiqi Granules (QJYQ) is a Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) 
      prescription for the patients with post-COVID-19 condition. It is essential to 
      carry out the quality evaluation of QJYQ. A comprehensive investigation was 
      conducted by establishing deep-learning assisted mass defect filter 
      (deep-learning MDF) mode for qualitative analysis, ultra-high performance liquid 
      chromatography and scheduled multiple reaction monitoring method (UHPLC-sMRM) for 
      precise quantitation to evaluate the quality of QJYQ. Firstly, a deep-learning 
      MDF was used to classify and characterize the whole phytochemical components of 
      QJYQ based on the mass spectrum (MS) data of ultra-high performance liquid 
      chromatography quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry 
      (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS). Secondly, the highly sensitive UHPLC-sMRM data-acquisition 
      method was established to quantify the multi-ingredients of QJYQ. Totally, nine 
      major types of phytochemical compounds in QJYQ were intelligently classified and 
      163 phytochemicals were initially identified. Furthermore, fifty components were 
      rapidly quantified. The comprehensive evaluation strategy established in this 
      study would provide an effective tool for accurately evaluating the quality of 
      QJYQ as a whole.

TI  - Therapeutic Potential of Propolis Extract in Managing Hyperinflammation and Long 
      COVID-19: A Bioinformatics Study.
PG  - e202401947
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.202401947 [doi]
AB  - Hyperinflammation is a significant factor in long COVID, impacting over 65 
      million post-COVID-19 individuals globally. Herbal remedies, including propolis, 
      show promise in reducing severity and pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the 
      natural pharmacological role of propolis in COVID-19 management remains 
      underexplored. Employing network pharmacology and in silico techniques, we 
      assessed propolis extract's potential in countering SARS-CoV-2-induced 
      inflammation. We identified 80 flavonoids via LC-MS/MS QTOF and employed 11 
      anti-inflammatory drugs as references for inflammation target fishing. Utilizing 
      in silico techniques encompassing target fishing, molecular docking, and 
      dynamics, we examined propolis' effects. We identified 1105 gene targets 
      connected to inflammation through multiple validated target predictors. By 
      integrating SARS-CoV-2 DEGs from GSE147507 with these targets, we identify 25 
      inflammation-COVID-19-associated propolis targets, including STAT1, NOS2, CFB, 
      EIF2K2, NPY5R, and BTK. Enrichment analyses highlighted primary pharmacological 
      pathways related to Epstein-Barr virus infection and COVID-19. Molecular docking 
      validated isokaempferide, iristectorigenin B, 3'-methoxypuerarin, cosmosiin, and 
      baicalein-7-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, which exhibited strong binding affinity and 
      stability with relevant genes. Moreover, our findings indicate that propolis 
      ligands could potentially suppress reactivation of Epstein-Barr Virus infections 
      in post-COVID-19 cases. However, this study has a limitation in that the 
      concentration of each propolis compound has not been quantified. Therefore, 
      further exploration of propolis compounds quantification and experimental 
      validation are needed to support these findings.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Digital biometrics can be used to monitor disease, but there is 
      limited research on their applications for assessing postacute sequelae of 
      SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) or long COVID. OBJECTIVE: To better understand digital 
      biometric patterns in long COVID using wearable device technology and whether 
      there are any differences between the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 
      placebo-ritonavir intervention arms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      secondary analysis is an exploratory substudy of a placebo-controlled randomized 
      clinical trial (Selective Trial of Paxlovid for PASC [STOP-PASC]) that was 
      conducted from November 2022 to September 2023 at Stanford University. Trial 
      participants were randomized, and a subset enrolled into the prespecified 
      substudy. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive oral 
      nirmatrelvir (300 mg) and ritonavir (100 mg) or placebo-ritonavir twice daily for 
      15 days. Substudy participants were provided with a smartwatch and asked to wear 
      it for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for the 15-week study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Mean changes in digital biometric measures in physical activity, heart 
      rate, and oxygen saturation tracked by a smartwatch. Biometric measures were 
      summarized by treatment arm for each of 5 different time frames: baseline, 
      treatment period, and 3 subsequent time intervals. Summary measure trajectories 
      were clustered and demographics and clinical characteristics were compared among 
      clusters using absolute standardized differences expressed in units of SDs. 
      RESULTS: Of the 94 participants enrolled in the substudy, 50 (37 in 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 13 in placebo-ritonavir) met the analysis eligibility 
      criteria based on wear time and data completeness. These participants had a mean 
      (SD) age of 42.7 (13.2) years and included 29 females (58.0%). Using mixed models 
      for repeated measures, no significant differences were detected between the 
      intervention arms in the change in biometric measures over time, consistent with 
      the patient-reported outcomes in the STOP-PASC trial. In the overall substudy 
      cohort, latent class mixed models and cluster analysis identified distinct 
      longitudinal trajectories of long COVID over the 15-week study that tracked with 
      different symptoms. Participants with lower daytime physical activity reported 
      more severe fatigue (9 of 9 [100%] vs 21 of 23 [91.3%]; absolute standardized 
      difference [ASD], 0.30), shortness of breath (9 of 9 [100%] vs 7 of 23 [30.4%]; 
      ASD, 1.31), and cardiovascular symptoms (8 of 9 [88.9%] vs 12 of 23 [52.2%]; ASD, 
      0.70). Those with higher nighttime physical activity reported more 
      gastrointestinal symptoms (2 of 3 [66.7%] vs 11 of 35 [31.4%]; ASD, 0.50). 
      Additionally, participants with higher median daytime heart rates reported less 
      fatigue (7 of 9 [77.8%] vs 39 of 40 [97.5%]; ASD, 0.63) and shortness of breath 
      (3 of 9 [33.3%] vs 23 of 40 [57.5%]; ASD, 0.50) compared with those with lower 
      heart rates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This secondary analysis identified 
      distinct longitudinal trajectories of physiological and behavioral digital 
      biometric measures captured from wearable devices that reflect the heterogeneity 
      and track with different symptoms of long COVID. Digital biometric measures from 
      wearable devices have promising utility for long COVID research. TRIAL

AB  - Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), represents a major global 
      health challenge, with its underlying mechanisms remaining poorly understood 
      despite substantial research and clinical trials. This study investigates the 
      role of the interferon (IFN) axis in the pathogenesis of PASC, drawing parallels 
      to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The potential pathogenic role of IFNs was 
      detected by meta-analyses of mRNA sequencing data comparing PASC patients to 
      healthy controls. We analyzed serum samples from 39 PASC patients and found 
      significant correlations among multiple IFN sub types, including IFN alpha-2, 
      beta, gamma, lambda-1, and lambda-2/3. The biological activity of IFNs in the 
      serum was positively correlated with levels of both total and type III IFNs. 
      Notably, we detected the widespread presence of anti-double-stranded DNA 
      (anti-dsDNA) and anti-Smith (anti-Sm) antibodies in these patients, with 
      anti-dsDNA levels showing a strong correlation with IFN activity. On the basis of 
      these findings, we propose a hypothetical autoimmune pathogenesis for PASC 
      highlighting the crucial role of IFN signaling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic period is 
      experiencing better asthma control, fewer exacerbations, and health care 
      utilization, with limited data on factors that could explain this phenomenon. 
      OBJECTIVE: To confirm these improved asthma outcomes during COVID-19 and evaluate 
      potential contributing factors. METHODS: In 18,912 pediatric patients with asthma 
      treated in the Children's Hospital of Orange County network from 2017 to 2020, 
      monthly asthma-related encounters and medication summaries were extracted from 
      electronic health records, particulate matter 2.5 (PM(2.5)) air pollution from 
      the California Air Resources Board, and influenza-like illness from Illness 
      Surveillance Network for the first 6 months of each year. Changes in outcomes 
      between January to March and April to June (post-COVID-19 shutdown in 2020) were 
      compared with historical data using generalized estimating equations analyses for 
      patient outcomes and generalized linear models for pollution exceedance, 
      influenza-positive, and telehealth visit rates. RESULTS: During COVID-19, we 
      found 78%, 90%, 68% reductions in hospitalization, emergency department visits, 
      and exacerbations, respectively, compared with pre-COVID-19 2020, with 
      significantly greater changes than the same time period of 2017 to 2019 and 
      significant reductions in albuterol and inhaled corticosteroid use (P < .05). 
      Emergency department visit reduction was not seen for African Americans. The 
      PM(2.5) and influenza rates were also significantly reduced during COVID-19 (P < 
      .05). Increased rates in telehealth visits were greater in the publicly insured 
      group when compared with commercially insured. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm 
      reduced health care utilization and suggest better asthma control during 
      COVID-19, except for African Americans. This was associated with a significant 
      increase in telehealth visits and reductions in PM(2.5) and influenza infections, 
      but not better asthma controller adherence.

TI  - Examining the role of micronutrients on improving long COVID sleep-related 
      symptoms.
PG  - 5040-5049
LID - 10.1111/jocn.16326 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Long COVID is defined as the continuation of symptoms for 
      four or more weeks after initial contraction of the virus. This review article 
      examines the role of four select micronutrients (zinc, vitamins C, D and 
      polyphenols) for their anti-inflammatory and therapeutic potential to improve 
      sleep-related symptoms in persons with long COVID. BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests 
      a link between long COVID and increased inflammation. There are currently no 
      therapeutic interventions for common sleep-related symptoms associated with long 
      COVID. Micronutrients, due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, 
      may have a role in the treatment of sleep-related symptoms in the context of long 
      COVID. DESIGN: A narrative literature review was conducted and guided by the 
      PRISMA checklist. METHODS: All articles were screened from PubMed, ScienceDirect, 
      NCBI or Google Scholar and were limited to human studies. The following keywords 
      were used: 'COVID-19', 'sleep symptoms', 'zinc', 'vitamin C', 'vitamin D', 
      'polyphenols' and 'micronutrients'. RESULTS: There are currently no studies that 
      examine the usage of micronutrients and its impacts on long-term, sleep-related 
      symptoms post-COVID-19 infection. We focussed our review on prior studies that 
      examined micronutrients in the context of sleep symptoms and inflammation, while 
      exploring the potential for micronutrients to help improve sleep-related symptoms 
      associated with long COVID. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that 
      sleep-related symptoms associated with long COVID, such as fatigue and poor sleep 
      quality, are associated with inflammation. Zinc, vitamins C, D and polyphenols 
      all have the potential to improve both inflammation and sleep quality to 
      alleviate symptoms. Future research should further examine these micronutrients 
      in the context of long COVID to improve sleep and quality of life. RELEVANCE TO 
      CLINICAL PRACTICE: This article provides implications for clinicians to be at the 
      forefront of research on the usage of micronutrients to improve sleep-related 
      symptoms in persons with long COVID.

TI  - Inhibitory Effect of Luteolin on Spike S1 Glycoprotein-Induced Inflammation in 
      THP-1 Cells via the ER Stress-Inducing Calcium/CHOP/MAPK Pathway.
LID - 10.3390/ph17101402 [doi]
LID - 1402
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The global SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has escalated into a 
      critical public health emergency, with the spike glycoprotein S1 subunit of 
      SARS-CoV-2 (spike-S1) linked to inflammation in lung tissue and immune cells. 
      Luteolin, a flavone with anti-inflammatory properties, shows promise, but 
      research on its effectiveness against long-COVID-related inflammation and spike 
      protein-induced responses remains limited. This study aims to elucidate the 
      underlying mechanisms of inflammation in THP-1 cells induced by the spike-S1. 
      Additionally, it seeks to assess the potential of luteolin in mitigating 
      inflammatory responses induced by the spike-S1 in a THP-1 macrophage model. 
      METHODS: The gene expression profiles of spike-S1 in THP-1 cells were analyzed by 
      transcriptome sequencing. The inhibitory effect of luteolin on ER stress and 
      inflammation in spike-S1-induced THP-1 cells was investigated using Western 
      blotting, RT-PCR, and ELISA. RESULTS: The candidate genes (CAMK2A, SIGLEC7, 
      PPARGC1B, SEC22B, USP28, IER2, and TIRAP) were upregulated in the 
      spike-S1-induced THP-1 group compared to the control group. Among these, 
      calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CAMK2A) was identified as 
      the most promising molecule in spike-S1-induced THP-1 cells. Our results indicate 
      that the spike S1 significantly increased the expression of ER-stress markers at 
      both gene and protein levels. Luteolin significantly reduced ER stress by 
      decreasing the expression of ER-stress marker genes and ER-stress marker proteins 
      (p < 0.01). Additionally, luteolin exhibited anti-inflammatory properties upon 
      spike S1-induction in THP-1 cells by significantly suppressing IL-6, IL-8, and 
      IL-1β cytokine secretion in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). Furthermore, our 
      results revealed that luteolin exhibited the downregulation of the MAPK pathway, 
      as evidenced by modulating the phosphorylation of p-ERK1/2, p-JNK and p-p38 
      proteins (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study elucidate the 
      mechanisms by which the spike S1 induces inflammation in THP-1 cells and supports 
      the use of naturally occurring bioactive compounds, like luteolin, against 
      inflammation-related SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - Effects of Pycnogenol® in people with post-COVID-19 condition (PYCNOVID): study 
      protocol for a single-center, placebo controlled, quadruple-blind, randomized 
      trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of the global population has been infected 
      with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at some point 
      since the onset of the pandemic. Although most individuals who develop 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recover without complications, about 6% have 
      persistent symptoms, referred to as post-COVID-19 condition (PCC). Intervention 
      studies investigating treatments that potentially alleviate PCC-related symptoms 
      and thus aim to mitigate the global public health burden and healthcare costs 
      linked to PCC are desperately needed. The PYCNOVID trial investigates the effects 
      of Pycnogenol®, a French maritime pine bark extract with anti-inflammatory and 
      antioxidative properties, versus placebo on patient-reported health status in 
      people with PCC. METHODS: This is a single-center, placebo-controlled, quadruple 
      blind, randomized trial. We aim to randomly assign 150 individuals with PCC (1:1 
      ratio) to receive either 200 mg Pycnogenol® or placebo daily for 12 weeks. 
      Randomization is stratified for duration of PCC symptoms (≤ 6 months 
      versus > 6 months) and presence of symptomatic chronic disease(s). The primary 
      endpoint is perceived health status at 12 weeks (EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale) 
      adjusted for baseline values and stratification factors. Secondary endpoints 
      include change in self-reported PCC symptoms, health-related quality of life, 
      symptoms of depression and anxiety, cognitive function, functional exercise 
      capacity, physical activity measured with accelerometry, and blood biomarkers for 
      endothelial health, inflammation, coagulation, platelet function, and oxidative 
      stress. Investigators, study participants, outcome assessors, and data analysts 
      are blinded regarding the intervention assignment. Individuals with PCC were 
      involved in the design of this study. DISCUSSION: This is the first trial to 
      investigate the effects of Pycnogenol® versus placebo on patient-reported health 
      status in people with PCC. Should the trial proof clinical effectiveness, 
      Pycnogenol® may serve as a therapeutic approach to mitigate symptoms associated 
      with PCC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - The most common symptom reported by patients after recovery from coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) is fatigue. However, robust clinical evidence supporting 
      the effectiveness of treatments and interventions for fatigue in COVID-19 
      survivors is lacking. This pilot clinical trial aims to assess the safety and 
      efficacy of Kyungok-go, a herbal preparation targeting fatigue, in patients after 
      recovering from COVID-19. The study will include 100 participants with persistent 
      fatigue for more than 12 weeks after COVID-19 recovery. They will be randomly 
      allocated into two groups: the Kyungok-go group (n =  50) and the placebo group 
      (n =  50). Kyungok-go or placebo will be administered twice daily for 12 weeks, 
      and the participants will be assessed at 4-week intervals. The primary outcome 
      will be the change in the Fatigue Severity Scale score. Secondary outcomes will 
      include cognitive function, physical function, quality of life, depression, sleep 
      quality, medication adherence, and feasibility. This study is the first attempt 
      to investigate the safety and efficacy of Kyungok-go for relieving fatigue 
      related to long COVID. The results are expected to contribute to the 
      establishment of a knowledge base and reveal the potential of herbal medicine 
      prescriptions for managing and recovering from the most common sequelae of 
      COVID-19. Trial registration number: KCT0008789.

TI  - Budget impact of oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in adults at high risk for 
      progression to severe COVID-19 in the United States.
PG  - 1290-1302
LID - 10.18553/jmcp.2023.29.12.1290 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMV/r) is indicated for the treatment of 
      mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to 
      severe COVID-19. NMV/r has also been authorized for emergency use by the US Food 
      and Drug Administration for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in 
      pediatric patients (aged 226512 years and weighing at least 40 kg) who are at 
      high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. Understanding the budget impact of 
      introducing NMV/r for the treatment of adults with COVID-19 is of key interest to 
      US payers. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the annual budget impact of introducing NMV/r 
      in a US commercial health plan setting in the current Omicron COVID-19 era. 
      METHODS: A budget impact model was developed to assess the impact of NMV/r on 
      health care costs in a hypothetical 1-million-member commercial health insurance 
      plan over a 1-year period in the US population; clinical and cost inputs were 
      derived from published literature with a focus on studies in the recent COVID-19 
      era that included vaccinated population and predominance of the Omicron variant. 
      In the base-case analysis, it was assumed the only effect of NMV/r was a 
      reduction in incidence (not severity) of hospitalization or death; its potential 
      effect on post-COVID conditions was assessed in a scenario analysis. Outcomes 
      included the number of hospitalizations, total cost, per patient per year (PPPY) 
      costs, and per member per month (PMPM) costs. Sensitivity and scenario analyses 
      were conducted to assess uncertainty around key model inputs. RESULTS: An 
      estimated 29,999 adults were eligible and sought treatment with oral antiviral 
      for COVID-19 over 1 year. The availability of NMV/r was estimated to reduce the 
      number of hospitalizations by 647 with a total budget impact of $2,733,745, $91 
      PPPY, and $0.23 PMPM. NMV/r was cost saving when including post-COVID conditions 
      with a -$1,510,780 total budget impact, a PPPY cost of -$50, and a PMPM cost of 
      -$0.13. Sensitivity analyses indicated results were most sensitive to the risk of 
      hospitalization under supportive care, risk of hospitalization with NMV/r 
      treatment and cost of NMV/r. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with NMV/r in the current 
      COVID-19 era is estimated to result in substantial cost offsets because of 
      reductions in hospitalization and modest budget impact to potential overall cost 
      savings.

TI  - Nitric Oxide at the Nexus of ACE2 Biology and COVID-19: Implications for 
      Cardiovascular and Neurodegenerative Comorbidities.
PG  - S171-S184
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 engages ACE2 for cell entry, perturbing the counter-regulatory 
      ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis and shifting the renin angiotensin system toward ACE/Ang 
      II/AT1 signaling, with a concomitant reduction in nitric oxide (NO) 
      bioavailability. NO sits at the crossroads of these pathways, acting both as an 
      antiviral modulator of spike-ACE2 interactions and as a downstream mediator of 
      Mas-dependent endothelial protection. This review summarizes evidence on NO 
      across three layers: (i) viral entry (S nitrosylation of spike/ACE2, protease 
      modulation), (ii) cardiovascular comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, diabetes) 
      where ACE2 downregulation impairs endothelial NO synthase (eNOS)-dependent NO 
      production and promotes thrombosis and microvascular dysfunction, and (iii) 
      neurovascular/ neurodegenerative sequelae, in which renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
      system (RAAS) dysregulation along with imbalance between protective eNOS/nNOS and 
      inflammatory iNOS fosters blood-brain barrier disruption, microthrombosis, and 
      cognitive impairment. Shared mechanisms - endotheliitis, microvascular 
      dysfunction, and neuroinflammation may explain convergent risks for cardiac 
      injury and cognitive decline in long COVID-19. Putative therapeutic strategies 
      may include restoring physiological NO (via Mas agonism, Ang-(1-7), inhibition of 
      Ang 1-7 degradation and recombinant ACE2), pulmonary-selective inhaled NO, hybrid 
      S nitrosylated agents, and selective attenuation of iNOS/peroxynitrite alongside 
      endothelial support. Targeted modulation - enhancing eNOS/nNOS while constraining 
      iNOS offers a unified framework to mitigate both cardiovascular and 
      neurodegenerative consequences of COVID-19.

TI  - COVID-19 Adaptations in the Care of Patients with Opioid Use Disorder: a Survey 
      of California Primary Care Clinics.
PG  - 998-1005

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, many federal agencies relaxed 
      policies regulating opioid use disorder treatment. The impact of these changes 
      has been minimally documented. The abrupt nature of these shifts provides a 
      naturalistic opportunity to examine adaptations for opioid use disorder treatment 
      in primary care. OBJECTIVE: To examine change in medical and behavioral health 
      appointment frequency, visit type, and management of patients with opioid use 
      disorder in response to COVID-19. DESIGN: A 14-item survey queried primary care 
      practices that were enrolled in a medications for opioid use disorder statewide 
      expansion project. Survey content focused on changes in service delivery because 
      of COVID-19. The survey was open for 18 days. PARTICIPANTS: We surveyed 338 
      clinicians from 57 primary care clinics located in California, including 
      federally qualified health centers and look-alikes. A representative from all 57 
      clinics (100%) and 118 staff (34.8% of all staff clinicians) participated in the 
      survey. MAIN MEASURES: The survey consisted of seven dimensions of practice: 
      medical visits, behavioral health visits, medication management, urine drug 
      screenings, workflow, perceived patient demand, and staff experience. KEY 
      RESULTS: A total of 52 of 57 (91.2%) primary care clinics reported practice 
      adaptations in response to COVID-19 regulatory changes. Many clinics indicated 
      that both medical (40.4%) and behavioral health visits (53.8%) were now 
      exclusively virtual. Two-thirds (65.4%) of clinics reported increased duration of 
      buprenorphine prescriptions and reduced urine drug screenings (67.3%). The 
      majority (56.1%) of clinics experienced an increase in patient demand for 
      behavioral health services. Over half (56.2%) of clinics described having an 
      easier or unchanged experience retaining patients in care. CONCLUSIONS: Many 
      adaptations in the primary care approach to patients with opioid use disorder may 
      be temporary reactions to COVID-19. Further evaluation of the impact of these 
      adaptations on patient outcomes is needed to determine whether changes should be 
      maintained post-COVID-19.

TI  - Thromboembolic safety and clinical benefits of tranexamic acid beyond hemostasis 
      in post-COVID-19 patients undergoing major arthroplasty: A STROBE-compliant 
      retrospective study.
PG  - e44317

LID - e44317
AB  - The safety of tranexamic acid (TXA) in patients with recent coronavirus disease 
      (COVID-19) infection undergoing major arthroplasty remains unclear. We aimed to 
      evaluate whether TXA increases thromboembolic risk in post-COVID-19 patients 
      undergoing major arthroplasty. Using the TriNetX database, we identified patients 
      aged ≥50 years who underwent total knee or hip arthroplasty with documented 
      COVID-19 within 3 months prior to surgery. Patients who received TXA on the day 
      of surgery were compared with those who did not. The primary outcome was 6-month 
      risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), with secondary outcomes including cerebral 
      infarction, mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, acute kidney injury 
      (AKI), sepsis, and pneumonia. After matching (26,366 patients for each group), 
      analysis revealed that TXA use was not associated with an increased risk of VTE 
      (odds ratio [OR] 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-1.32, P = .404), 
      cerebral infarction (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.67-1.09, P = .215), mortality (OR 0.81, 
      95% CI 0.60-1.10, P = .174), or other complications at 6 months. Notably, TXA was 
      associated with a significantly reduced risk of ICU admissions (OR 0.74, 95% CI 
      0.62-0.89, P = .001). Sensitivity analysis showed that TXA provided additional 
      benefits in patients with prior COVID-19 hospitalization, including reduced 
      mortality (OR 0.53, P = .003), lower risk of AKI (OR 0.79, P = .002), and 
      decreased incidence of sepsis (OR 0.77, P = .038). Sex-based analysis revealed 
      more pronounced benefits in female patients, particularly for ICU admission and 
      AKI. TXA use in post-COVID patients undergoing major arthroplasty was associated 
      with better long-term outcomes without increasing thromboembolic risk, supporting 
      the continued use of TXA in this patient population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Little was known about the characteristics of low respiratory tract 
      (LRT) microbiota of refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia (RMPP) in children before 
      and after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Forty-two children diagnosed with RMPP 
      in 2019 (Y2019 group) and 33 children diagnosed with RMPP in 2023 (Y2023 group), 
      entered into the study. The characteristics of the clinical findings were 
      examined, and the LRT microbiota was analyzed by metagenomic next generation 
      sequencing. RESULTS: The ratio of consolidate, atelectasis, lung necrosis, and 
      erythema multiforme in Y2023 group was significantly higher than that in Y2019 
      (P<0.05). Mycoplasmoides pneumoniae was the top species of the LRT microbiota in 
      both groups. The rate of macrolide resistance MP in Y2023 was significantly 
      higher than that in Y2019 (P<0.05), and the mutant site was all 23S rRNA A2063G. 
      There were no significant differences in α-diversity and β-diversity of LRT 
      microbiota between Y2019 and Y2023 group. Trichoderma citrinoviride, Canine 
      mastadenovirus A, Ralstonia pickettii, Lactococcus lactis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      were the biomarkers of LRT microbiota in children with RMPP of Y2023. The 
      abundance of Mycoplasmoides pneumoniae positively correlated with the levels of 
      D-dimer and LDH, negatively correlated with the counts of CD3(+) T cells, CD8(+) 
      T cells, CD19(+) B cells and CD16(+)CD56(+) NK cells. DISCUSSION: Our study 
      showed that high abundance of MP was correlated with the severity of RMPP and 
      decrease of immune cells. Trichoderma citrinoviride, Canine mastadenovirus A, 
      Ralstonia pickettii, Lactococcus lactis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the 
      biomarkers in microbiota of LRT in children with RMPP post COVID-19 era.

TI  - Outcome of transcutaneous retrobulbar injection of liposomal amphotericin B in 
      post-COVID-19 rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis: Our experience.
PG  - 1019-1024
LID - 10.4103/ijo.IJO_2356_21 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the outcome and response of transcutaneous retrobulbar 
      injection of amphotericin B (TRAMB) in post-coronavirus disease of 2019 
      (COVID-19) rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) and to establish a scoring 
      system in guiding treatment modalities. METHODS: An interventional, prospective 
      study was done on 82 eyes of post-COVID-19 ROCM from May 2021 to July 2021. A 
      comprehensive multi-departmental evaluation along with detailed ophthalmic 
      examination, laboratory investigations, and radiological examination was done. 
      Scoring points were given to each symptom, sign, and radiological features of 
      orbit and the total score was taken. Based on these scores, severity of disease 
      was grouped into A, B, and C corresponding to mild, moderate, and severe orbital 
      ROCM. One milliliter of reconstituted liposomal amphotericin B was given to all 
      patients every alternate day as three doses. Efficacy of these injections was 
      assessed in all groups, even though other treatment modalities like orbital 
      debridement and exenteration were considered for moderate and severe cases. 
      Patients were followed up for a period of 8 weeks. RESULTS: Out of 82 eyes, 
      symptomatic improvement was seen in a major proportion (72%) of patients. A 
      statistically significant improvement in scores was noted in group A (93% 
      improved) with a P value of 0.002, while 68.4% showed improvement in group B 
      (P-value- 0.0001). Group C with severe disease showed minimal improvement in 
      post-injection scores of 41% (P-value 0.086), necessitating surgical 
      intervention. No serious adverse effect of the drug or procedure was noted. 
      CONCLUSION: Significant improvement in scores of groups A and B highlights TRAMB

TI  - Methadone treatment utilization and overdose trends among Medicaid beneficiaries

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the traditional mode of methadone 
      maintenance treatment (MMT) delivery through the imposition of lockdowns and 
      social distancing measures. In response, policy makers granted flexibilities to 
      providers delivering MMT to change their practices to maintain patient 
      participation while accommodating the measures imposed to prevent the spread of 
      COVID-19. This study examines the utilization of MMT and overdoses of patients 
      receiving MMT during the COVID-19 pandemic in one mid-Atlantic state. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: We analyzed Medicaid claims data for 2018-2020, calculating weekly 
      trends for starts, discontinuations, and medically-treated overdoses for 
      beneficiaries receiving MMT who had been continuously enrolled in Medicaid for 
      the previous 12 months, to account for changes in the composition of the Medicaid 
      population following the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE). We completed 
      data analyses from January to June 2022. RESULTS: We observed countervailing 
      trends in new starts, which experienced an immediate, non-significant dip of 
      -22.47 per 100,000 Medicaid beneficiaries (95%CI, -50.99 to 6.04) at the outset 
      of the pandemic followed by an increasing upward trend of 1.41 per 100,000 
      beneficiaries per week (95%CI, 0.37 to 2.46), and in discontinuations, which also 
      experienced an immediate dip of -3.23 per 1000 MMT enrollees (95%CI, -4.49 to 
      -1.97) followed by an increasing upward trend of 0.14 per 1000 MMT enrollees per 
      week (95%CI, 0.09 to 0.19). The net result of these shifts was a stable, slowly 
      increasing rate of MMT treatment of 0.02 % per week before and after the PHE. We 
      also found no statistically significant association of the PHE with 
      medically-treated overdoses among beneficiaries enrolled in MMT (trend 
      change = 0.02 overdoses per 10,000 MMT enrollees, 95%CI, -0.05 to 0.09). 
      CONCLUSIONS: New Jersey achieved overall stability in MMT treatment prevalence 
      following the pandemic's onset, while some changes in treatment dynamics took 
      place. This outcome may reflect that the extensive flexibilities granted to 
      providers of MMT by the state and federal government successfully maintained 
      access to MMT for Medicaid beneficiaries through the pandemic without increasing 
      risk of medically-treated overdose. These findings should inform policy makers 
      developing the post-COVID-19 legal and regulatory landscape.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a common interstitial pneumonia disease, 
      also occurred in post-COVID-19 survivors. The mechanism underlying the anti-PF 
      effect of Qing Fei Hua Xian Decotion (QFHXD), a traditional Chinese medicine 
      formula applied for treating PF in COVID-19 survivors, is unclear. This study 
      aimed to uncover the mechanisms related to the anti-PF effect of QFHXD through 
      analysis of network pharmacology and experimental verification. METHODS: The 
      candidate chemical compounds of QFHXD and its putative targets for treating PF 
      were achieved from public databases, thereby we established the corresponding 
      "herb-compound-target" network of QFHXD. The protein-protein interaction network 
      of potential targets was also constructed to screen the core targets. 
      Furthermore, Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
      (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were used to predict targets, and pathways, 
      then validated by in vivo experiments. RESULTS: A total of 188 active compounds 
      in QFHXD and 50 target genes were identified from databases. The key therapeutic 
      targets of QFHXD, such as PI3K/Akt, IL-6, TNF, IL-1β, STAT3, MMP-9, and TGF-β1 
      were identified by KEGG and GO analysis. Anti-PF effects of QFHXD (in a 
      dose-dependent manner) and prednisone were confirmed by HE, Masson staining, and 
      Sirius red staining as well as in vivo Micro-CT and immunohistochemical analysis 
      in a rat model of bleomycin-induced PF. Besides, QFXHD remarkably inhibits the 
      activity of PI3K/Akt/NF-κB and TGF-β1/Smad2/3. CONCLUSIONS: QFXHD significantly 
      attenuated bleomycin-induced PF via inhibiting inflammation and 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition. PI3K/Akt/NF-κB and TGF-β1/Smad2/3 pathways 
      might be the potential therapeutic effects of QFHXD for treating PF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A subset of individuals (10-20%) experience post-COVID condition 
      (PCC) subsequent to initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, which lacks effective 
      treatment. PCC carries a substantial global burden associated with negative 
      economic and health impacts. This study aims to evaluate the association between 
      plasma taurine levels with self-reported symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes 
      in patients with PCC. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed the plasma proteome and 
      metabolome of 117 individuals during their acute COVID-19 hospitalization and at 
      the convalescence phase six-month post infection. Findings were compared with 28 
      age and sex-matched healthy controls. Plasma taurine levels were negatively 
      associated with PCC symptoms and correlated with markers of inflammation, 
      tryptophan metabolism, and gut dysbiosis. Stratifying patients based on the 
      trajectories of plasma taurine levels during six-month follow-up revealed a 
      significant association with adverse clinical events. Increase in taurine levels 
      during the transition to convalescence were associated with a reduction in 
      adverse events independent of comorbidities and acute COVID-19 severity. In a 
      multivariate analysis, increased plasma taurine level between acute and 
      convalescence phase was associated with marked protection from adverse clinical 
      events with a hazard ratio of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.05-0.35; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Taurine emerges as a promising predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic 
      target in PCC. Taurine supplementation has already demonstrated clinical benefits 
      in various diseases and warrants exploration in large-scale clinical trials for 
      alleviating PCC.

      A prospective cohort study (the SECURe study).
PG  - 652-661
LID - 10.1113/EP091757 [doi]
AB  - Many patients exhibit persistently reduced pulmonary diffusing capacity after 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, dual test gas diffusing 
      capacity for carbon monoxide and nitric oxide (D(L,CO,NO)) metrics and their 
      relationship to disease severity and physical performance were examined in 
      patients who previously had COVID-19. An initial cohort of 148 patients diagnosed 
      with COVID-19 of all severities between March 2020 and March 2021 had a 
      D(L,CO,NO) measurement performed using the single-breath method at 5.7 months 
      follow-up. All patients with at least one abnormal D(L,CO,NO) metric (n = 87) 
      were revaluated at 12.5 months follow-up. The D(L,CO,NO) was used to provide the 
      pulmonary diffusing capacity for nitric oxide (D(L,NO)), the pulmonary diffusing 
      capacity for carbon monoxide (D(L,CO,5s)), the alveolar-capillary membrane 
      diffusing capacity and the pulmonary capillary blood volume. At both 5.7 and 
      12.5 months, physical performance was assessed using a 30 s sit-to-stand test and 
      the 6 min walk test. Approximately 60% of patients exhibited a severity-dependent 
      decline in at least one D(L,CO,NO) metric at 5.7 months follow-up. At 
      12.5 months, both D(L,NO) and D(L,CO,5s) had returned towards normal but still 
      remained abnormal in two-thirds of the patients. Concurrently, improvements in 
      physical performance were observed, but with no apparent relationship to any 
      D(L,CO,NO) metric. The severity-dependent decline in D(L,NO) and D(L,CO) observed 
      at 5.7 months after COVID-19 appears to be reduced consistently at 12.5 months 
      follow-up in the majority of patients, despite marked improvements in physical 
      performance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic progressive disorder and 
      is diagnosed as post-COVID fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has no 
      effective treatment because of the low therapeutic effects and side effects of 
      currently available drugs. AIM: The aim is to screen new inhibitors against 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis from traditional Chinese medicines. METHODS: 
      Few-shot-based machine learning and molecule docking were used to predict the 
      potential activities of candidates and calculate the ligand-receptor 
      interactions. In vitro A549 cell model was taken to verify the effects of the 
      selected leads on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. RESULTS: A logistic regression 
      classifier model with an accuracy of 0.82 was built and, combined with molecule 
      docking, used to predict the activities of candidates. 6 leads were finally 
      screened out and 5 of them were in vitro experimentally verified as effective 
      inhibitors against idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Herbacetin, 
      morusin, swertiamarin, vicenin-2, and vitexin were active inhibitors against 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Swertiamarin exhibited the highest anti-idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis effect and should be further in vivo investigated for its 
      activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance mechanisms (RMs) inevitably develop during osimertinib 
      treatment in EGFR mutation positive (EGFRm+) NSCLC, and may guide subsequent 
      therapy. We hypothesized that a complete RM analysis requires next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissue and plasma in patients experiencing disease 
      progression (PD) on first-line osimertinib. METHODS: At time of PD during 
      osimertinib treatment, patients underwent plasma and tissue NGS for RM analysis. 
      Plasma was analyzed with AVENIO ctDNA expanded panel, tissue with DNA and RNA NGS 
      following local standards. Successful sequencing was defined by EGFRm 
      identification. RESULTS: Between February 2020 and January 2024, 150 patients 
      were enrolled. Plasma sequencing was successful in 84 %, tissue sequencing in 
      94 %, both in 81 % of patients. In total, 159 RMs covered by both modalities were 
      identified, 76 % in tissue, 59 % in plasma. Concordance was 34 %. In 54 patients, 
      EGFR, MET and/or ERBB2 were amplified. At least one amplification was found in 
      both sources for 17 patients, in tissue only for 25. Median EGFRm variant allele 
      frequency (VAF) in plasma differed between these groups (25.9 vs 3.0 %, 
      P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In case of low EGFRm VAF in plasma, combining tumor and 
      plasma sequencing uncovers additional RMs compared to any single modality. 
      Utilizing both for complete RM assessment is therefore recommended.

AB  - PURPOSE: Various medications are administered to treat Coronavirus Disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) infection and prevent its complications. Some medicines have 
      complications and long-term effects, which may mimic other conditions, making 
      precise diagnosis difficult. This report aims to bring to light one such 
      complication, medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), secondary to a 
      commonly prescribed medication for preventing lung fibrosis post-COVID-19 
      infection. METHOD: A 33-year-old male reported to our department with the typical 
      clinical and radiological features of Mucormycosis of the upper jaw post-COVID-19 
      infection. However, on detailed evaluation of his history (controlled diabetic 
      and short duration of steroid therapy) and review of the mycology staining, 
      bacteriology, culture, and histopathological reports, we came to a negative 
      diagnosis for Mucormycosis. The patient was, however, on treatment for the 
      prevention of lung fibrosis with Nintedanib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) 150 mg 
      twice a day for one month. RESULT: In the absence of predisposing factors and 
      negative laboratory findings for mucormycosis, we arrived at a diagnosis of 
      MRONJ, attributable to Nintedanib therapy given to prevent lung fibrosis 
      post-COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: The use of Nintedanib has recently increased 
      due to the high incidence of lung fibrosis post-COVID-19 infection. However, 
      Nintedanib should be considered a causative agent for osteonecrosis of the jaw in 
      the absence of other obvious predisposing factors. Therefore, Nintedanib must be 
      administered after a thorough consideration of risk factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) remains a major health issue worldwide, 
      while its pathophysiology is still poorly understood. Systemic oxidative stress 
      (OS) may be involved in PCS, which is reflected by lower circulating free thiols 
      (R-SH, sulfhydryl groups), as they are receptive to rapid oxidation by reactive 
      species. This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal dynamics of serum R-SH 
      after SARS-CoV-2 infection and its association with the development of PCS in 
      individuals with mild COVID-19. METHODS: Baseline serum R-SH concentrations were 
      measured and compared between 135 non-hospitalized COVID-19 subjects and 82 
      healthy controls (HC). In COVID-19 subjects, serum R-SH concentrations were 
      longitudinally measured during the acute disease phase (up to 3 weeks) and at 3, 
      6, and 12 months of follow-up, and their associations with relevant clinical 
      parameters were investigated, including the development of PCS. RESULTS: Baseline 
      albumin-adjusted serum R-SH were significantly reduced in non-hospitalized 
      COVID-19 subjects as compared to HC (p = 0.041), reflecting systemic OS. In mild 
      COVID-19 subjects, trajectories of albumin-adjusted serum R-SH levels over a 
      course of 12 months were longitudinally associated with the future presence of 
      PCS 18 months after initial infection (b = -9.48, p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: 
      Non-hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 show evidence of systemic oxidative 
      stress, which is longitudinally associated with the development of PCS. Our 
      results provide a rationale for future studies to further investigate the value 
      of R-SH as a monitoring biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in the 
      development of PCS.

AB  - To investigate relevant biomarkers that might aid in the diagnosis and monitoring 
      of long COVID (LC), an analysis of IFN-α, IFN-β, ISG15, and ISG56 transcripts was 
      performed by Real-Time PCR among people of working age who had been infected with 
      SARS-CoV-2 one year prior to the study [LC and non-long COVID (NLC)]. Despite no 
      differences in the transcript levels of IFN-α, IFN-β, ISG15, and ISG56 between LC 
      and NLC, higher IFN-β mRNA levels were observed among LC compared to NLC 
      individuals who were hospitalized for more than 10 days during acute SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. Moreover, previously SARS-CoV-2 infected participants that did not 
      require respiratory support and developed LC exhibited higher levels of IFN-α and 
      IFN-β compared to NLC with the same clinical characteristics. These results 
      highlight that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to changes in peripheral innate immune 
      pathways, which could have implications for the development of LC.

AB  - Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, some individuals develop Long-COVID-syndrome 
      lasting for more than 3 months. We analyzed blood samples from patients with 
      Long-COVID, controls without persistent symptoms following SARS-CoV-2-infection 
      and non-infected donors without a history of infection. Long-COVID patients 
      showed clear signs of T cell hyper-activation predominantly in the CD8(+) T cell 
      subset with a 4-fold higher expression of CD25 and 2-fold more effector-memory T 
      cells. Following polyclonal T cell stimulation, we found a 2-fold stronger 
      upregulation of CD25 and a 7-fold higher release of IL-3 in Long-COVID. 
      Intracellular staining revealed 5-fold more IL-3-expressing CD8(+) T cells in 
      Long-COVID, while GM-CSF, IFN-γ and IL-2 were much less upregulated. These 
      changes correlated with the severity of Long-COVID and persisted for up to 
      18 months after infection. Our data reveal a pronounced and long-lasting CD8(+) T 
      cell hyper-activation and hyper-reactivity in Long-COVID and speak for a trial of 
      T cell-immunosuppression in patients with Long-COVID.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lagerstreomia speciosa and its active compound, 
      corosolic acid, enhances cefotaxime inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus 
      aureus.

AB  - AIMS: Various epidemiology studies have reported the emergence of Staphylococcus 
      aureus and its methicillin resistance strain causing global health concerns, 
      especially during and post-COVID-19 pandemic. This pathogen presents as a 
      co-infection in patients with COVID-19. In addition, certain virulence factors 
      and resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, including cefotaxime, have been 
      identified. We aimed to investigate the antibacterial activity of Lagerstreomia 
      speciosa, a medicinal plant with antidiabetic activity, against S. aureus, 
      including the strain resistant to methicillin. Furthermore, we examined whether 
      the extract and one of its bioactive compounds, corosolic acid, can enhance the 
      therapeutic effect of cefotaxime on antibiotic-resistant S. aureus. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration of each substance was determined 
      using the standard broth microdilution test following the checkerboard dilution. 
      The type of interactions, synergistic, additivity, indifference, or antagonism, 
      were determined using isobolograms analysis and the dose reduction index (DRI). 
      The evaluation of synergy and bactericidal activity of the natural products in 
      combination with cefotaxime was performed using the time-kill kinetic assay. 
      Corosolic acid, L. speciosa leaves extract, and bark extract alone showed 
      antibacterial activity against all tested S. aureus ATCC 33591, S. aureus ATCC 
      29213, S. aureus ATCC 25923, and clinical isolated S. aureus. Corosolic acid 
      enhanced the antibacterial activity of cefotaxime, showing a synergistic effect 
      and greater DRI of cefotaxime against all tested S. aureus strains. Time-kill 
      kinetic assay showed that corosolic acid has a more profound effect than L. 
      speciosa extracts to potentiate the bactericidal activity of cefotaxime. Whereas 
      L. speciosa leaves and bark extract showed some inhibitory effect on the growth 
      of S. aureus after a single administration. CONCLUSIONS: Lagerstreomia speciosa 
      leaves and bark extract and its active compound, corosolic acid, could be used as 
      a potential anti-Staphylococcus aureus treatment to enhance the therapeutic use 
      of cefotaxime.

TI  - Improvement on Ferrous Ion Accumulation and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in the 
      COVID-19 Pseudovirus-Infected Cell Model Simulating the Long COVID Status by 
      Nutritional Strategy.

AB  - The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) has plunged the world into a major crisis of overwhelming morbidity 
      and mortality and emerged various mutant strains. Patients recovering from 
      SARS-CoV-2 develop post-acute COVID syndrome, commonly known as long COVID (LC), 
      lasting up to 12 weeks or even longer. The mechanism has yet to be clarified. 
      COVID-19 pseudovirus is a suitable model to understand the infection of the 
      COVID-19 virus to cells, which is suitable to see the acute change in cells owing 
      to its one-time infection and inactivation. The ACE2-293T cell infected by 
      COVID-19 pseudovirus was used in this study. After the infection and removal of 
      the pseudovirus, high amounts of ferrous ions were accumulated in mitochondria 
      and then released into the cytosol. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation 
      was formed and caused mitochondrial dysfunction. To evaluate the effect of 
      nutritional strategy on ferrous ion accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction, 
      lactoferrin, Q10 and Echinacea purpurea extract (EPE) were used in this study. 
      Results showed that lactoferrin, Q10 and EPE could improve mitochondrial 
      dysfunction by reducing the accumulation of ferrous ions and ROS in the 
      mitochondria. HPLC analysis showed that EPE contained rich caffeic acid, and it 
      also showed perfect improvement in mitochondrial dysfunction. In conclusion, 
      cells infected with pseudovirus could increase the accumulation of ferrous ions 
      and ROS in mitochondria and be released into the cytosol after removing 
      pseudovirus, thereby causing mitochondrial dysfunction. Lactoferrin, Q10 and EPE 
      were an effective nutritional strategy to suppress ferrous ion accumulation, ROS 
      formation and advanced mitochondrial dysfunction.

AB  - Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is characterized by persistent symptoms and reduced 
      mental and physical performance following the acute phase of COVID-19. The 
      underlying mechanisms remain unclear but may involve gut microbiota dysbiosis and 
      immune-related changes in amino acid metabolism. This pilot study aimed to 
      investigate whether specific bacterial uremic metabolites (BUM) are altered in 
      patients with post-infectious syndromes and whether these alterations are 
      associated with PCS symptoms. We examined BUM in 25 PCS patients, 8 Myalgic 
      Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) patients, and 8 healthy 
      controls (Ctrls). Concentrations of BUM were determined in second morning urine 
      samples using mass spectrometry (Biovis Diagnostik, Limburg, Germany). 
      Standardized questionnaires assesed physical, cognitive, psychological, and 
      somatic symptoms and mental health status. PCS and ME/CFS patients exhibited 
      significantly higher scores for post-exertional malaise (PEM) and somatic symptom 
      severity compared to healthy controls (p<0.001). Elevated BUM concentrations were 
      found in 64% of PCS patients, compared to 37.5% of both healthy controls and 
      ME/CFS patients. While overall BUM levels did not significantly differ between 
      groups, heatmap clustering revealed distinct metabolic patterns. Elevated 
      tryptamine and 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (HPHPA) and higher hippuric acid and 
      trimethylamine concentrations, were exclusively analysed in patients with 
      post-infectious syndromes. Our pilot study suggests that urine metabolomic 
      analysis may be a useful approach for investigating the role of gut dysbiosis and 
      BUM in patients with PCS.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is involved in various neurological and neurodegenerative 
      disorders in which the activation of microglia is one of the key factors. In this 
      study, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of the flavonoids nobiletin 
      (5,6,7,8,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone) and eriodictyol 
      (3',4',5,7-tetraxydroxyflavanone) on human microglia cell line activation 
      stimulated by either lipopolysaccharide (LPS), severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) full-length Spike protein (FL-Spike), or the mycotoxin 
      ochratoxin A (OTA). Human microglia were preincubated with the flavonoids (10, 
      50, and 100 µM) for 2 h, following which, they were stimulated for 24 h. The 
      inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 
      8 (CXCL8), IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were quantified in the 
      cell culture supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Both 
      nobiletin and eriodictyol significantly inhibited the LPS, FL-Spike, and 
      OTA-stimulated release of IL-1β, CXCL8, IL-6, and MMP-9 at 50 and 100 µM, while, 
      in most cases, nobiletin was also effective at 10 µM, with the most pronounced 
      reductions at 100 µM. These findings suggest that both nobiletin and eriodictyol 
      are potent inhibitors of the pathogen-stimulated microglial release of 
      inflammatory mediators, highlighting their potential for therapeutic application 
      in neuroinflammatory diseases, such as long COVID.

TI  - Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal) for promoting recovery in long covid: 
      protocol for a randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial (APRIL Trial).
PG  - e094526

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long covid describes a syndrome of persistent symptoms following 
      COVID-19 and is responsible for substantial healthcare and economic burden. 
      Currently, no effective treatments have been established. Ashwagandha (Withania 
      somnifera (L.) Dunal) is a medicinal herb traditionally used in India for its 
      immune-strengthening and anti-inflammatory properties. Withanolides, a family of 
      steroid-derived molecules unique to Ashwagandha, have been shown to modulate 
      inflammatory pathways in animal models, and several small randomised trials in 
      humans support its effectiveness for reducing symptoms that are also associated 
      with long covid. Therefore, this study aims to assess whether Ashwagandha is 
      effective and safe for improving functional status and reducing symptom burden in 
      adults living with long covid. METHODS: A randomised double-blind 
      placebo-controlled trial will be performed at participating general practice (GP) 
      surgeries and long covid clinics across the UK. Individuals diagnosed with long 
      covid will be screened for eligibility and then randomised 1:1 to take 1000 mg 
      daily of Ashwagandha root extract tablets (standardised to <0.9% withanolides) or 
      matching placebo tablets for 3 months (target, n = 2500). Monthly online surveys 
      will be performed to collect patient-reported outcomes, and monthly safety 
      monitoring, including liver function tests, will be conducted by clinical site 
      teams. The primary outcome of the Post-COVID Functional Status Scale score at 3 
      months will be assessed by baseline-adjusted ordinal logistic regression, 
      according to a pre-published statistical analysis plan. The secondary outcomes 
      included validated quality of life and long covid symptom scales, work status and 
      productivity and adverse events. The trial has been approved as a Clinical Trial 
      of an Investigational Medicinal Produce by the Medicines and Healthcare 
      Regulatory Authority and by the NHS Research Ethics Committee and Health Research 
      Authority. DISCUSSION: Treatments for long covid are urgently needed. This trial 
      will robustly evaluate the safety and efficacy of a candidate treatment with a 
      promising efficacy and safety profile. If found to be effective, the findings 
      will likely influence treatment guidelines and improve health outcomes in those 
      living with long covid. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This trial was pre-registered 
      on 15/08/2022: ISRCTN12368131.

AB  - Pneumocystis jirovecii is a ubiquitous opportunistic fungus that can cause 
      life-threatening pneumonia. The clinical manifestations of pneumonia caused by 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and P. jirovecii are similar, 
      posing a significant challenge in the diagnosis of P. jirovecii pneumonia or 
      coronavirus disease 2019. Herein, we report a case of P. jirovecii pneumonia 
      diagnosed through bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum smear analyses. The patient 
      recovered successfully and was discharged following combination therapy with 
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and corticosteroids. Early diagnosis and prompt 
      treatment are of vital importance in managing P. jirovecii pneumonia, 
      particularly in individuals with related risk factors for P. jirovecii pneumonia 
      development.

AB  - Рost-COVID-19 syndrome (PS) is one of the medical and social problem. According 
      to WHO, 10-20% of COVID-19 patients suffer from PS. The use of medical gases - 
      inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and molecular hydrogen (iH(2)) - may influence on the 
      mechanisms of development PC. AIM: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the 
      combined inhalation of NO and H(2) (iNO/iH(2)) in patients with respiratory 
      manifestations of PS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 34 patients with PS (11 men/23 
      women, 60.0±11.7 years) were included in the prospective open-label controlled 
      study in parallel groups: the main group (n=17) received iNO/iH(2) for 90 minutes 
      once a day for 10 days (concentration of NO 60 ppm, H(2)<4% in the gas mixture), 
      the control group (n=17) didn't receive inhalations. The period from the 
      confirmation of COVID-19 to the start of the study was 641.8±230.5 days. The 
      groups did not differ in the baseline parameters. The clinical symptoms (from the 
      self-observation diary and mMRC questionnaires, "dyspnea language"), FAS, HADS, 
      SF-36 scores, 6-minute walk test, the blood serum parameters of oxidative stress, 
      the dynamics of the microcirculation in the eye bulbar conjunctiva were 
      evaluated. The individual dose of iNO has chosen during a 15-minute test (the 
      positive dynamics of the microcirculation have indicated that the dose was 
      selected correctly). RESULTS: The decrease the symptoms severity, such as 
      dyspnea, cough, fatigue and palpitations (p<0.005), the increase in SF-36 
      questionnaire scores (p=0.006) and a reducing of FAS score (p=0.001), as well as 
      the anxiety component of HADS (p=0.02) were revealed at the end of treatment in 
      the main group compared to the control group. We observed an improvement in 
      distance walked (p=0.01) and the values SpO(2) (p=0.04) in 6-minute walk test, 
      the increase in the volumetric blood flow velocity in venules (p<0.001), and the 
      date in oxidative damage (p<0.001) and antioxidant activity (p=0.03) parameters 
      in the blood serum. CONCLUSION: The results of the study demonstrate clinical 
      efficacy iNO/iH(2) on clinical indicators, parameters of oxidative stress and 
      microcirculation in patients with PS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There has been an increase of attention and awareness of smell and 
      taste loss due to the impact of COVID-19. However, little is known about the 
      influence of COVID-19 on the number of psychophysical tests performed, the timing 
      of these tests, or the protection protocols employed to protect against virus 
      transmission. This study aimed to explore the changes in examination approaches, 
      types of tests employed, and safety measures adopted by clinicians before and 
      after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A survey was distributed to 404 institutes 
      of the Oto-Rhino Laryngological Society of Japan, consisting of otolaryngologists 
      working in university hospitals, general hospitals, and private clinics. The 
      anonymous online survey contained questions related to safety measures and 
      chemosensory assessments performed before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      Specifically, participants were queried on the number and types of examinations 
      conducted, the type of examiners who performed them, the timing of tests in 
      suspected and non-suspected COVID-19 cases, modifications made due to the 
      pandemic, and the protective measures adopted during chemosensory examinations. 
      RESULTS: Of the 201 respondents, representing a 50 % response rate, 49 % were 
      from general hospitals, 48 % from university hospitals, and 3 % from private 
      clinics. The study found a slight decrease in the overall number of chemosensory 
      tests conducted post-COVID-19. In terms of who performed the test, there were no 
      differences pre- and post- COVID-19. Most examinations (52-68 %) for suspected 
      COVID-19 cases were performed 1-2 months after the onset of symptoms. 
      Modifications in testing rooms and personal protective equipment (PPE) were 
      reported by the majority of institutions post-pandemic. While different 
      examination rooms or PPE were not commonly used based on a patient's previous 
      COVID-19 diagnosis, changes were observed in testing practices. Most examinations 
      were conducted in rooms with windows or fans, and PPE usage was high; surgical 
      masks, eye visors or face shields, and disposable gloves being commonly used. 
      Virus transmission from patient to examiner was reported in only one case during 
      T&T olfactometer examination. CONCLUSION: We investigated the impact of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic on the number of olfactory and gustatory tests performed, the 
      type of examiner, the examination room, and the use of PPE and found no 
      significant difference before and after the COVID-19 pandemic on these factors. 
      Adherence to a protection protocol involving the proper use of PPE in controlled 
      environments enabled the continuation of olfactory and gustatory tests during the 
      pandemic.

      in patients with post-COVID-19-syndrome (PreVitaCOV) - protocol of a randomised, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial in primary care (phase IIIb).

AB  - BACKGROUND: After infection with SARS-CoV-2 a relevant proportion of patients 
      complains about persisting symptoms, a condition termed Post-COVID-19-syndrome 
      (PC19S). So far, possible treatments are under investigation. Among others, 
      neurotropic vitamins and anti-inflammatory substances are potential options. 
      Thus, the PreVitaCOV trial aims to assess feasibility, safety, and effectiveness 
      of treating patients in primary care with prednisolone and/or vitamin B1, B6 and 
      B12. METHODS: The phase IIIb, multi-centre randomised, double-blind, and 
      placebo-controlled PreVitaCOV trial has a factorial design and is planned as a 
      two-phase approach. The pilot phase assessed feasibility and safety and was 
      transformed into a confirmatory phase to evaluate effectiveness since feasibility 
      was proven. Adult patients with PC19S after a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection at 
      least 12 weeks ago are randomly assigned to 4 parallel treatments: prednisolone 
      20 mg for five days followed by 5 mg for 23 days (trial drug 1), B vitamins (B1 
      (100 mg OD), B6 (50 mg OD), and B12 (500 µg OD)) for 28 days (trial drug 2), 
      trial drugs 1 and 2, or placebo. The primary outcome of the pilot phase was 
      defined as the retention rate of the first 100 patients. Values of ≥ 85% were 
      considered as confirmation of feasibility, this criterion was even surpassed by a 
      retention rate of 98%. After transformation, the confirmatory phase proceeds by 
      enrolling 240 additional patients. The primary outcome for the study is the 
      change of symptom severity from baseline to day 28 as assessed by a tailored 
      Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) total score 
      referring to five symptom domains known to be typical for PC19S (fatigue, 
      dyspnoea, cognition, anxiety, depression). The confirmatory trial is considered 
      positive if superiority of any treatment is demonstrated over placebo 
      operationalised by an improvement of at least 3 points on the PROMIS total score 
      (t-score). DISCUSSION: The PreVitaCOV trial may contribute to the understanding 
      of therapeutic approaches in PC19S in a primary care context. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with long COVID lack evidence-based treatments and have 
      difficulty participating in traditional site-based trials. Our digital, 
      decentralized trial investigates the efficacy and safety of 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, targeting viral persistence as a potential cause of long 
      COVID. METHODS: The PAX LC trial (NCT05668091) is a Phase 2, 1:1 randomized, 
      double-blind, superiority, placebo-controlled trial in 100 community-dwelling, 
      highly symptomatic adult participants with long COVID residing in the 48 
      contiguous US states to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 15 
      days of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir compared with placebo/ritonavir. Participants are 
      recruited via patient groups, cultural ambassadors, and social media platforms. 
      Medical records are reviewed through a platform facilitating participant-mediated 
      data acquisition from electronic health records nationwide. During the drug 
      treatment, participants complete daily digital diaries using a web-based 
      application. Blood draws for eligibility and safety assessments are conducted at 
      or near participants' homes. The study drug is shipped directly to participants' 
      homes. The primary endpoint is the PROMIS-29 Physical Health Summary Score 
      difference between baseline and Day 28, evaluated by a mixed model repeated 
      measure analysis. Secondary endpoints include PROMIS-29 (Mental Health Summary 
      Score and all items), Modified GSQ-30 with supplemental symptoms questionnaire, 
      COVID Core Outcome Measures for Recovery, EQ-5D-5L (Utility Score and all items), 
      PGIS 1 and 2, PGIC 1 and 2, and healthcare utilization. The trial incorporates 
      immunophenotyping to identify long COVID biomarkers and treatment responders. 
      CONCLUSION: The PAX LC trial uses a novel decentralized design and a 
      participant-centric approach to test a 15-day regimen of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
      for long COVID.

TI  - A journey through anticoagulant therapies in the treatment of left ventricular 
      thrombus in post-COVID-19 heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a case report.
PG  - 318-321
LID - 10.1080/16078454.2022.2043572 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated adverse 
      drug reaction associated with thrombosis. Clinical scoring systems and the 
      presence of anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-PF4)/heparin antibodies determine the 
      diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old man who was treated with 
      acenocoumarol due to a chronic left ventricular thrombus was admitted to the 
      hospital for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and pulmonary embolism. The patient was 
      started on bemiparin and discharged. Left lower limb acute arterial ischemia and 
      thrombocytopenia were diagnosed 18 days later. Computed tomography angiography 
      revealed a large left ventricular thrombus and multiple arterial thrombi. Left 
      femoral-popliteal thromboembolectomy was performed. Anti-PF4/heparin antibodies 
      confirmed an HIT diagnosis. Fondaparinux (7.5 mg/24 h) was initiated, but cardiac 
      surgery was necessary. Bivalirudin was used during surgery, with an initial load 
      (1.25 mg/kg) and maintenance infusion (2.5 mg/kg/h). The cardiac thrombus was 
      extracted, but the patient experienced a postsurgical myocardial infarction. 
      Percutaneous cardiovascular intervention (PCI) required a bivalirudin load 
      (0.75 mg/kg) and maintenance infusion (1.75 mg/kg/h). No coronary lesions were 
      detected, and argatroban was started afterwards (0.5 µg/kg/min). When the 
      platelet count exceeded 100 × 10(9)/L, acenocoumarol was initiated. Thereupon, 
      acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/24 h) was added. No other complications have been 
      reported to date. CONCLUSION: The clinical presentation of intraventricular and 
      multiple arterial thrombi is remarkable. SARS-CoV-2 infection likely contributed 
      to a hypercoagulable state. The management of patients with HIT undergoing 
      cardiac surgery is challenging. If surgery cannot be delayed, then treatment with 
      bivalirudin is recommended. Additionally, this drug is recommended for PCI. 
      Bivalirudin is safe and well-tolerated in both procedures.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected over 770 million people worldwide. The 
      long-term effects of COVID-19 and their management have become important issues. 
      Accumulating evidence indicates that post-COVID-19 syndrome, also known as long 
      COVID, is not limited to respiratory symptoms but affects a wide range of 
      systems, including neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, 
      musculoskeletal, and reproductive systems etc. The social and economic losses 
      associated with these effects are estimated to reach 3·7 trillion dollars in the 
      United States alone. However, no treatment for long COVID has been developed. 
      Herein, the literature on long COVID is comprehensively reviewed to examine the 
      underlying causes. Additionally, evidence supporting the efficacy of 
      nanoengineered niclosamide is presented, given its ability to counteract the 
      underlying causes. Niclosamide is already Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA)-approved, and the nanoengineered one is a viable candidate for clinical 
      trials for long COVID.

      Abnormal Blood Clotting: A Patent-Based Appraisal.
LID - 10.3390/v16030450 [doi]
LID - 450
AB  - People affected by COVID-19 are exposed to, among others, abnormal clotting and 
      endothelial dysfunction, which may result in deep vein thrombosis, 
      cerebrovascular disorders, and ischemic and non-ischemic heart diseases, to 
      mention a few. Treatments for COVID-19 include antiplatelet (e.g., aspirin, 
      clopidogrel) and anticoagulant agents, but their impact on morbidity and 
      mortality has not been proven. In addition, due to viremia-associated 
      interconnected prothrombotic and proinflammatory events, anti-inflammatory drugs 
      have also been investigated for their ability to mitigate against immune 
      dysregulation due to the cytokine storm. By retrieving patent literature 
      published in the last two years, small molecules patented for long-COVID-related 
      blood clotting and hematological complications are herein examined, along with 
      supporting evidence from preclinical and clinical studies. An overview of the 
      main features and therapeutic potentials of small molecules is provided for the 
      thromboxane receptor antagonist ramatroban, the pan-caspase inhibitor emricasan, 
      and the sodium-hydrogen antiporter 1 (NHE-1) inhibitor rimeporide, as well as 
      natural polyphenolic compounds.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outburst is still threatening 
      global health. This highly contagious viral disease is caused by the infection of 
      SARS-CoV-2 virus. Covid-19 and post-Covid-19 complications induce noteworthy 
      mortality. Potential chemical hits and leads against SARS-CoV-2 for combating 
      Covid-19 are urgently required. In the present study, a virtual-screening 
      protocol was executed on potential Amaryllidaceae alkaloids from a pool of 
      natural compound library against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) and 
      transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2). For the collected 1016 alkaloids from 
      the curated library, initially, molecular docking using AutoDock Vina (ADV), and 
      thereafter 100 ns molecular-dynamic (MD) simulation has been executed for the 
      best top-ranked binding affinity compounds for both the viral and host proteins. 
      Comprehensive intermolecular-binding interactions profile of Amaryllidaceae 
      alkaloids suggested that phyto-compounds Galantamine, Lycorenine, and Neronine as 
      potent modulators of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and host TMPRSS2 protein. All atomistic 
      long range 100 ns MD simulation studies of each top ranked complex in triplicates 
      also illustrated strong binding affinity of three compounds towards M(pro) and 
      TMPRSS2. Identified compounds might be recommended as prospective anti-viral 
      agents for future drug development selectively targeting the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) or 
      blocking host TMPRSS2 receptor, subjected to pre-clinical and clinical assessment 
      for a better understanding of in-vitro molecular interaction and in-vivo 
      validation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term symptomatology of COVID-19 has yet to be 
      comprehensively described. The aim of the study was to describe persistent 
      COVID-19 symptoms in a cohort of hospitalized and home-isolated patients. 
      METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on long COVID patients. Long 
      COVID symptoms were identified, and patients were divided into hospitalized 
      (in-patients) and home-isolated (out-patients), as well as according to the 
      number of symptoms. Patients were examined by a multidisciplinary medical team. 
      Blood tests, high resolution chest computed tomography (CT), and physical and 
      infectious examinations were performed. Finally, in-patients were evaluated at 2 
      time-points: on hospital admission (T0) and 3 months after discharge (Tpost). 
      RESULTS: There were 364 COVID-19 patients enrolled; 82% of patients reported one 
      or more symptoms. The most reported symptom was fatigue. Chest CT showed 
      alteration in 76% of patients, and pulmonary function alterations were observed 
      in 44.7% of patients. A higher risk of presenting at least one symptom was seen 
      in patients treated with corticosteroid, and a higher risk of presenting chest CT 
      residual lesion was observed in hospitalized patients and in patients that 
      received hydroxychloroquine treatment. Moreover, a higher risk of altered 
      pulmonary function was observed in older patients. CONCLUSION: Long-term sequelae 
      are present in a remarkable number of long COVID patients and pose a new 
      challenge to the health care system to identify long-lasting effects and improve 
      patients' well-being. Multidisciplinary teams are crucial to develop preventive 
      measures, and clinical management strategies.

TI  - Ultramicronized Palmitoylethanolamide and Luteolin: Drug Candidates in 
      Post-COVID-19 Critical Illness Neuropathy and Positioning-Related Peripheral 
      Nerve Injury of the Upper Extremity.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the most dramatic pandemic of the new 
      millennium and patients with serious infection can stay in intensive care unit 
      (ICU) for weeks in a clinical scenario of systemic inflammatory response 
      syndrome, likely related to the subsequent development of critical illness 
      polyneuropathy (CIP). It is in fact now accepted that COVID-19 ICU surviving 
      patients can develop CIP; moreover, prone positioning-related stretch may favor 
      the onset of positioning-related peripheral nerve injuries (PNI). Therefore, the 
      urgent need to test drug candidates for the treatment of these debilitating 
      sequelae is emerged even more. For the first time in medical literature, we have 
      successfully treated after informed consent a 71-year-old Italian man suffering 
      from post-COVID-19 CIP burdened with positioning-related PNI of the left upper 
      extremity by means of ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide 400 mg plus 
      ultramicronized luteolin 40 mg (Glìalia), two tablets a day 12 hours apart for 6 
      months. In the wake of our pilot study, a larger clinical trial to definitively 
      ascertain the advantages of this neuroprotective, neurotrophic, and 
      anti-inflammatory therapy is advocated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac symptoms due to postacute inflammatory cardiac involvement 
      affect a broad segment of previously well people with only mild acute coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness and without overt structural heart disease. 
      Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can identify the underlying 
      subclinical disease process, which is associated with chronic cardiac symptoms. 
      Specific therapy directed at reducing postacute cardiac inflammatory involvement 
      before development of myocardial injury and impairment is missing. METHODS: 
      Prospective multicenter randomized placebo-controlled study of myocardial 
      protection therapy (combined immunosuppressive/antiremodeling) of low-dose 
      prednisolone and losartan. Consecutive symptomatic individuals with a prior 
      COVID-19 infection, no pre-existing significant comorbidities or structural heart 
      disease, undergo standardized assessments with questionnaires, CMR imaging, and 
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Eligible participants fulfilling the 
      criteria of subclinical post-COVID inflammatory heart involvement on baseline CMR 
      examination are randomized to treatment with either verum or placebo for a total 
      of 16 weeks (W16). Participants and investigators remain blinded to the group 
      allocation throughout the study duration. The primary efficacy endpoint is the 
      absolute change of left ventricular ejection fraction to baseline at W16, 
      measured by CMR, between the verum treatment and placebo group by absolute 
      difference, using unpaired t-test confirmatively at a significance level of 0.05 
      significance level. Secondary endpoints include assessment of changes of 
      symptoms, CMR parameters, and CPET after W16, and frequency of major adverse 
      cardiac events after 1 year. Safety data will be analyzed for frequency, 
      severity, and types of adverse events (AEs) for all treatment groups. The 
      proportion of AEs related to the contrast agent gadobutrol will also be analyzed. 
      A calculated sample size is a total of 280 participants (accounting for 22 
      subjects (8%) drop out), randomized in 1:1 fashion to 140 in the verum and 140 
      placebo groups. CONCLUSION: Myoflame-19 study will examine the efficacy of a 
      myocardial protection therapy in symptomatic participants with post-COVID 
      inflammatory cardiac involvement determined by CMR. The aim of the intervention 
      is to reduce the symptoms and inflammatory myocardial injury, improve exercise 
      tolerance, and preclude the development of cardiac impairment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: The purpose of the study is to increase the efficacy of 
      сomprehensive treatment in elderly patients with COPD , who have suffered of 
      coronavirus disease-COVID-19 in the last 3-6 months, by using nebulizer therapy 
      with N-acetylcysteine and 3% hypertonic sodium chloride solution (Flu-Acyl 
      broncho) and the drug glycine, to correct psychosomatic disorders. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Materials and methods: Under our supervision there were 60 elderly 
      patients with COPD gr D, who underwent Covid 19 in the last 3-6 months, were 
      under observation. The average age was 66.3±2.1 years. Рatients of the main and 
      control groups were prescribed complex basic therapy. However, mucolytic therapy 
      was administered to patients in the main group using combined drug - 
      N-acetylcysteine and 3% hypertonic sodium chloride solution through a 5.0 №10 
      nebulizer. For the treatment of astheno-neurotic disorders of postcovidal 
      syndrome was prescribed glycine 100 mg 2 times a day for 10 days. Subsequently, 
      Flu-Acyl broncho through a nebulizer at 5.0 No.10, and glycised was used in 
      courses once a day for 10 days per month. Patients in the control group were 
      prescribed acetylcysteine 200 mg 3 times a day N10. RESULTS: Results: The results 
      of observation for 6 months showed that in patients of the main group, recurrence 
      of the disease was not observed. whereas in patients of the control group in 6 
      patients (20%). CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Comprehensive treatment of elderly 
      patients with comorbid pathology - COPD group D and postcovidal syndrome, with 
      the additional use of nebulizer delivery of the combined drug - N-acetylcysteine 
      and 3% hypertonic sodium chloride solution in combination with the sedative drug 
      glycine, promotes improving the quality of life in patients, reducing the 
      duration of treatment, prevents recurrence and progression of COPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of opioids for breathlessness seen in 
      laboratory-based studies has not been replicated in clinical trials. We aimed to 
      assess the effectiveness of oral morphine for breathlessness in long-term 
      conditions. METHODS: This phase 3, parallel-group, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial across 11 centres randomly assigned consenting adults 
      (1:1, stratified by site and causal disease) with a modified Medical Research 
      Council breathlessness score of 3 or more due to cardiorespiratory conditions to 
      receive 5-10 mg twice daily oral long-acting morphine or placebo (as well as a 
      blinded laxative) for 56 days. The primary outcome was worst breathlessness score 
      in the past 24 h at day 28, measured using a numerical rating scale (NRS; 0=not 
      breathless at all; 10=worst imaginable breathlessness). Secondary outcomes 
      included physical activity levels, worst cough NRS, quality of life, and 
      morphine-related toxicities. Patients who received at least one dose of study 
      drug were eligible for inclusion in efficacy and safety analyses. The trial was 
      registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN87329095) and the EU Clinical Trials Register 
      (EudraCT 2019-002479-33). FINDINGS: Between March 18, 2021, and Oct 26, 2023, 143 
      participants were randomly assigned to receive either morphine (73 participants) 
      or placebo (67 participants) and were included in the analyses; three 
      participants did not receive the allocated treatment. Participants had a mean age 
      of 70·5 (SD 9·4) years, were mostly male (93 [66%]), and were mostly White (132 
      [94%]). By day 28, 64 (88%) participants in the morphine group versus 66 (99%) in 
      the placebo group had 90% adherence or greater. We found no evidence of 
      difference in worst breathlessness at day 28 (morphine 6·19 [95% CI 5·57 to 6·81] 
      vs placebo 6·10 [5·44 to 6·76]; adjusted mean difference 0·09 [95% CI -0·57 to 
      0·75], p=0·78) or any secondary measure, except for improved cough seen at day 56 
      (adjusted mean difference -1·41 [-2·18 to -0·64]). Increased moderate to vigorous 
      physical activity was seen at day 28 (adjusted mean difference 9·51 min/day 
      [0·54-18·48]) but this was not significant after multiple-measures correction. 
      The morphine group had more adverse events (251 vs 162), serious adverse events 
      (15 vs three, of which three in the morphine group and zero in the placebo group 
      were deemed to be related to the study), and study drug withdrawals (13 vs two). 
      There were no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence that 
      morphine improves worst breathlessness intensity. Further research is needed to 
      understand whether there is any role for morphine in chronic breathlessness, but 
      our findings do not support its use in this setting. FUNDING: NIHR Health

AB  - This study aims to delineate the epidemiological trends of carbapenem-resistant 
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in pediatric patients before, during, and after 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to assess the risk factors of 
      CRKP hospital-acquired infections (CRKP-HAIs) across these three periods. We 
      retrospectively collected the clinical data of pediatric patients diagnosed with 
      K. pneumoniae infection at the Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University 
      from January 2018 to March 2024. Carbapenemase-related genes were detected by 
      PCR, and statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 25.0. The current study 
      found that modifications in the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control measures 
      and antibiotic therapies impact the epidemiological trends and antimicrobial 
      resistance of CRKP. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed various 
      independent risk factors for CRKP-HAIs before, during, and after the COVID-19 
      pandemic. Healthcare institutions must intensify surveillance for HAIs, 
      continuously monitor and avoid risk factors for CRKP-HAIs, and formulate targeted 
      preventive and control measures to effectively reduce the incidence and spread of 
      these infections. Further, consistent surveillance of CRKP strains coproducing 
      carbapenemase genes is crucial for mitigating the potential health risks in 
      pediatric patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no known effective pharmacological therapy for long COVID, 
      which is characterized by wide-ranging, multisystemic, fluctuating, or relapsing 
      symptoms in a large proportion of survivors of acute COVID. This randomized 
      controlled trial aims to assess the safety and efficacy of an anti-inflammatory 
      agent colchicine, to reduce symptoms among those at high risk of developing long 
      COVID. METHODS: This multi-centre, parallel arm, 1:1 individual randomized, 
      placebo-controlled, double-blind superiority trial will enrol 350 individuals 
      with persistent post-COVID symptoms. Participants will be randomized to either 
      colchicine 0.5 mg once daily (< 70 kg) or twice daily (≥ 70 kg) or matched 
      placebo for 26 weeks and will be followed up until 52 weeks after randomization. 
      The primary trial objective is to demonstrate the superiority of colchicine over 
      a placebo in improving distance walked in 6 min at 52 weeks from baseline. The 
      secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of colchicine compared to placebo 
      with respect to lung function, inflammatory markers, constitutional symptoms, and 
      mental health state. In a sub-sample of 100 participants, cardiac biomarkers of 
      myocardial injury and myocardial oedema using MRI will be compared. DISCUSSION: 
      Persistent inflammatory response following SARS-CoV-19 is one of the postulated 
      pathophysiological mechanisms of long COVID. Colchicine, a low-cost 
      anti-inflammatory agent, acts via multiple inflammatory pathways and has an 
      established safety profile. This trial will generate evidence for an important 
      health priority that can rapidly translate into practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      This clinical trial has been registered prospectively on www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov 
      with registration CTRI/2021/11/038234 dated November 24, 2021.

AB  - In spite of tremendous efforts exerted in the management of COVID-19, the absence 
      of specific treatments and the prevalence of delayed and long-term complications 
      termed post-COVID syndrome still urged all concerned researchers to develop a 
      potent inhibitor of SARS-Cov-2. The hydromethanolic extracts of different parts 
      of E. mauritanica were in vitro screened for anti-SARS-Cov-2 activity. Then, 
      using an integrated strategy of LC/MS/MS, molecular networking and NMR, the 
      chemical profile of the active extract was determined. To determine the optimum 
      target for these compounds, docking experiments of the active extract's 
      identified compounds were conducted at several viral targets. The leaves extract 
      showed the best inhibitory effect with IC(50) 8.231±0.04 μg/ml. The jatrophane 
      diterpenes were provisionally annotated as the primary metabolites of the 
      bioactive leaves extract based on multiplex of LC/MS/MS, molecular network, and 
      NMR. In silico studies revealed the potentiality of the compounds in the most 
      active extract to 3CLpro, where compound 20 showed the best binding affinity. 
      Further attention should be paid to the isolation of various jatrophane 
      diterpenes from Euphorbia and evaluating their effects on SARS-Cov-2 and its 
      molecular targets.

AB  - After severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, a 
      minority of patients experience persistent or emerging symptoms, termed 'long 
      coronavirus disease (COVID)' or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. The molecular 
      causes of long COVID remain unclear, but disrupted immune functions, such as 
      inflammation and immune deficit, have been posited as factors. In this 
      retrospective cohort study, we measured markers of immune function in a group of 
      patients with long COVID up to 40 months post infection. As proxies for immune 
      function, we measured serum antibody levels, antibody neutralizing capability and 
      production of IFN gamma (IFN-γ) and IL-2 against SARS-CoV-2 and other viral 
      peptides. As expected, serum antibody levels increased over time with 
      vaccinations and reinfections with later variants of SARS-CoV-2. Patients also 
      showed corresponding increasing SARS-CoV-2-specific IL-2 responses and stable 
      IFN-γ responses. We observed no significant differences in immune responses among 
      patients with ongoing long COVID, those who had recovered from it or individuals 
      who recovered from acute COVID-19. Overall, we found no indication of a reduction 
      in these aspects of immune function after SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study 
      provides a valuable foundation for further research aimed at understanding the 
      causes of long COVID.

TI  - Association of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir with post-acute sequelae and mortality 
      among patients who are immunocompromised with COVID-19 in Hong Kong: a 
      retrospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir on post-COVID-19 outcomes for 
      individuals who are immunocompromised is understudied. We aimed to examine the 
      association of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir with post-acute sequelae and mortality 
      among patients who are immunocompromised and admitted to hospital with COVID-19. 
      METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study using territory-wide electronic 
      health records from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority and Hong Kong Department of 
      Health. Eligible patients were adults aged 18 years or older who tested positive 
      for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period (March 11, 2022, to Nov 9, 2023) and were 
      admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Four exposure groups were formed based on 
      immune status (immunocompromised or immunocompetent) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 
      status (yes or no). The primary outcome was post-acute inpatient death, starting 
      from 21 days after the positive RT-PCR date. Standardised mortality ratio 
      weighting with doubly robust adjustment was applied to control for confounders. 
      Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the outcomes. FINDINGS: 
      Between March 11, 2022, and Nov 9, 2023, there were 89 772 individuals with 
      positive RT-PCR tests, of whom 39 923 met eligibility criteria and were included 
      in the study cohort. 19 914 (49·9%) of 39 923 patients were female, 20 009 
      (50·1%) were male and the median age was 75·0 years (IQR 63·0-85·0). 846 (38·2%) 
      of 2217 patients who were immunocompromised and 14 586 (38·7%) of 37 706 patients 
      who were immunocompetent were prescribed nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Among the 
      patients who were immunocompromised, those patients who received 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir had significantly lower risk of post-acute inpatient death 
      (HR 0·58, 95% CI 0·45-0·74; p<0·0001) and hospitalisation for acute respiratory 
      distress syndrome (0·43, 0·20-0·90; p=0·024) than those who did not. A 
      significant negative interaction was found between immune status and 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir on post-acute all-cause hospitalisation (relative excess 
      risk due to interaction -0·84, 95% CI -1·30 to -0·37; p=0·0004). INTERPRETATION: 
      Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with reduced risk of post-acute inpatient 
      death among patients who were immunocompromised and admitted to hospital with 
      COVID-19. However, the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir on post-acute 
      hospitalisation outcomes was less pronounced in patients who were 
      immunocompromised than in patients who were immunocompetent. FUNDING: Health and

TI  - Unraveling antiviral efficacy of multifunctional immunomodulatory triterpenoids 
      against SARS-COV-2 targeting main protease and papain-like protease.
PG  - 228-241

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be over, but its variants 
      continue to emerge, and patients with mild symptoms having long COVID is still 
      under investigation. SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to elevated cytokine levels and 
      suppressed immune responses set off cytokine storm, fatal systemic inflammation, 
      tissue damage, and multi-organ failure. Thus, drug molecules targeting the 
      SARS-CoV-2 virus-specific proteins or capable of suppressing the host 
      inflammatory responses to viral infection would provide an effective antiviral 
      therapy against emerging variants of concern. Evolutionarily conserved 
      papain-like protease (PLpro) and main protease (Mpro) play an indispensable role 
      in the virus life cycle and immune evasion. Direct-acting antivirals targeting 
      both these viral proteases represent an attractive antiviral strategy that is 
      also expected to reduce viral inflammation. The present study has evaluated the 
      antiviral and anti-inflammatory potential of natural triterpenoids: azadirachtin, 
      withanolide_A, and isoginkgetin. These molecules inhibit the Mpro and PLpro 
      proteolytic activities with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) 
      values ranging from 1.42 to 32.7 μM. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) 
      analysis validated the binding of these compounds to Mpro and PLpro. As expected, 
      the two compounds, withanolide_A and azadirachtin, exhibit potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 
      activity in cell-based assays, with half-maximum effective concentration (EC(50)) 
      values of 21.73 and 31.19 μM, respectively. The anti-inflammatory roles of 
      azadirachtin and withanolide_A when assessed using HEK293T cells, were found to 
      significantly reduce the levels of CXCL10, TNFα, IL6, and IL8 cytokines, which 
      are elevated in severe cases of COVID-19. Interestingly, azadirachtin and 
      withanolide_A were also found to rescue the decreased type-I interferon response 
      (IFN-α1). The results of this study clearly highlight the role of triterpenoids 
      as effective antiviral molecules that target SARS-CoV-2-specific enzymes and also 
      host immune pathways involved in virus-mediated inflammation.

AB  - The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants with a higher contagious capability and 
      faster transmissible speed has imposed an incessant menace on global health and 
      the economy. The SARS-CoV-2 infection might reoccur and last much longer than 
      expected. Thence, there is a high possibility that COVID-19 can cause long-term 
      health problems. This condition needs to be investigated thoroughly, especially 
      the post-COVID-19 complications. Respiratory tract disorders are common and 
      typical complications after recovery. Until now, there has been a lack of data on 
      specialized therapeutic medicine for post-COVID-19 complications. The clinical 
      efficacy of NRICM101 has been demonstrated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 
      This herbal medicine may also be a promising therapy for post-COVID-19 
      complications, thanks to its phytochemical constituents. The potential 
      pharmacological mechanisms of NRICM101 in treating post-COVID-19 respiratory 
      complications were investigated using network pharmacology combined with 
      molecular docking, and the results revealed that NRICM101 may exert a beneficial 
      effect through the three primary pathways: PI3K/AKT, HIF-1, and TNF signaling 
      pathways. Flavonoids (especially quercetin) have a predominant role and synergize 
      with other active compounds to produce therapeutic effectiveness. Most of the 
      main active compounds exist in three chief herbal ingredients, including 
      Liquorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra), Scutellaria root (Scutellaria baicalensis), 
      and Mulberry leaf (Morus alba). To our knowledge, this is the first study of the

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent pulmonary dysfunction is common after COVID-19, yet 
      traditional assessments using carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) alone may 
      miss alveolar-capillary impairment. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether combining 
      nitric oxide (DLNO(5s)) and carbon monoxide (DLCO(5s)) diffusing capacities 
      enhances detection of post-COVID-19 lung impairment and whether summed z-scores 
      outperform individual measures in classifying affected individuals. DESIGN AND 
      METHODS: We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis using 
      hierarchical mixed-effects modelling. The dataset included 572 COVID-19 survivors 
      and 72 matched controls from six European centres. Lung function 
      metrics-including spirometry, total lung capacity, DLNO(5s) and DLCO(5s)-were 
      standardised into z-scores. Logistic models were compared using Bayesian 
      Information Criterion and Leave-One-Out Information Criterion. Classification 
      accuracy was assessed with Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and net 
      reclassification improvement (NRI). Principal Component Analysis examined score 
      structures, and dyspnoea severity was correlated with z-scores. Assessments were 
      conducted 32-575 days post-infection (median=130 days). RESULTS: The number of 
      days between SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and testing did not affect any of the measured 
      z-scores. Summed DLNO(5s) + DLCO(5s) z-scores consistently outperformed 
      individual metrics. The combined model improved MCC by 0.06 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.11) 
      and NRI by 37% (95% CI 13 to 62%) over DLCO(5s) alone. The top model summed 
      DLNO(5s) + DLCO(5s) model explained 10% of fixed and 59% of random variance. 
      DLCO(5s) alone failed to identify reduced membrane diffusion in approximately 16% 
      of cases. Dyspnoea severity was significantly associated with all diffusion 
      indices (p<0.001), though combined scores showed no stronger correlation than 
      single predictors. CONCLUSION: Summed DLNO(5s) + DLCO(5s) z-scores enhance 
      classification of post-COVID-19 pulmonary impairment beyond DLCO(5s) alone. The 
      NO-CO double diffusion approach offers improved diagnostic discrimination between 
      previously infected individuals and controls and aligns with symptom severity. 
      These findings support broader clinical integration of combined diffusion metrics 
      in post-COVID assessment.

TI  - Socioeconomic status and prescribing of ADHD medications: a study of ICB-level 
      data in England.
LID - 10.1136/bmjment-2024-301384 [doi]
LID - e301384
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of healthcare structural changes and 
      socioeconomic indices, such as deprivation, mental health needs, and 
      inequalities, on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication 
      prescribing across different regions in England. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to 
      examine trends in ADHD medication prescribing and explore their association with 
      socioeconomic factors. METHODS: A population-level observational study was 
      conducted using the English Prescribing Dataset (from April 2019 to March 2024) 
      published by the NHS Business Services Authority and the OpenPrescribing platform 
      (Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, University of Oxford). The study 
      examined trends in five licensed ADHD medications at national, regional and 
      integrated care board (ICB) levels, using linear regression and a generalised 
      additive model to explore the association between socioeconomic factors and 
      prescription rates. FINDINGS: The prescriptions increased significantly from 
      25.17 items per 1000 population in 2019/20 (pre-COVID-19) to 41.55 items in 
      2023/24 (post-COVID-19), with an average annual increase of 18% nationally. 
      Methylphenidate remained the most prescribed medication, while lisdexamfetamine 
      showed the highest growth rate (55% annually, 95% CI 40% to 71%, p<0.01). 
      Significant regional variations were observed, with London experiencing the 
      highest annual increase (28%), and the Northeast and Yorkshire the lowest (13%). 
      Socioeconomic factors, including ethnicity and deprivation, were significantly 
      associated with ADHD prescription rates (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings reveal a 
      substantial increase in ADHD medication use in England following the COVID-19 
      pandemic, with significant variations at regional and ICB levels and complex 
      socioeconomic influences. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Findings highlight the need to 
      understand and address drivers of disparities in ADHD care while optimising 
      management strategies across diverse populations.

AB  - Long COVID (LC) or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) is defined 
      as ongoing, relapsing or new symptoms/conditions persisting after an acute 
      COVID-19 infection. Given the potential role of oral anticoagulants (OAC) in 
      treating thrombotic sequelae of LC/PASC, we investigated whether prevalent OAC 
      use at the time of acute COVID-19 infection was associated with reduced 
      development of LC/PASC. Retrospective cohort study within the TriNetx network. 
      The primary cohort was defined as adults with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. 
      We defined OAC users as those who had received OACs (either direct-acting OACs 
      [DOACs] or vitamin K antagonists [VKA]) in the preceding 3-months and non-users 
      as those without OAC use within the previous 12-months. The primary outcome was a 
      composite of 9 features associated with LC/PASC We identified 38,409 DOAC users, 
      19,243 VKA users, and 2,329,771 non-OAC users with acute COVID-19 infection. 
      After successful propensity score matching (PSM), we found an increased risk of 
      LC/PASC features in those receiving DOAC compared to non-OAC (HR [95% CI] 1.50 
      [1.35 to 1.68], p < 0.0001), and in VKA users compared to non-OACs (HR [95% CI] 
      1.98 [1.78 to 2.20], p < 0.0001), while DOAC users were at reduced risk compared 
      to VKA users (HR [95% CI] 0.71 [0.62 to 0.81], p < 0.0001). We found no evidence 
      that prevalent OAC at the time of acute COVID-19 infection was associated with 
      reduced risk of LC/PASC. Further work is needed to understand whether there is a 
      role for OAC therapy in the management of LC/PASC.

AB  - After three years of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the search and availability of 
      relatively low-cost benchtop therapeutics for people not at high risk for a 
      severe disease are still ongoing. Although vaccines and new SARS-CoV-2 variants 
      reduce the death toll, the long COVID-19 along with neurologic symptoms can 
      develop and persist even after a mild initial infection. Reinfections, which 
      further increase the risk of sequelae in multiple organ systems as well as the 
      risk of death, continue to require caution. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an 
      important target for both vaccines and therapeutics. The presence of disulfide 
      bonds in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is essential for 
      its binding to the human ACE2 receptor and cell entry. Here, we demonstrate that 
      thiol-reducing peptides based on the active site of oxidoreductase thioredoxin 1, 
      called thioredoxin mimetic (TXM) peptides, can prevent syncytia formation, 
      SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, and infection in a mouse model. We also show that 
      TXM peptides inhibit the redox-sensitive HIV pseudotyped viral cell entry. These 
      results support disulfide targeting as a common therapeutic strategy for treating 
      infections caused by viruses using redox-sensitive fusion. Furthermore, TXM 
      peptides exert anti-inflammatory properties by lowering the activation of NF-κB 
      and IRF signaling pathways, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokines in mice. The antioxidant and 
      anti-inflammatory effects of the TXM peptides, which also cross the blood-brain 
      barrier, in combination with prevention of viral infections, may provide a 
      beneficial clinical strategy to lower viral infections and mitigate severe 
      consequences of COVID-19.

AB  - Despite the recent and increasing knowledge surrounding COVID-19 infection, the 
      underlying mechanisms of the persistence of symptoms for a long time after the 
      acute infection are still not completely understood. Here, a multiplatform mass 
      spectrometry-based approach was used for metabolomic and lipidomic profiling of 
      human plasma samples from Long COVID patients (n = 40) to reveal mitochondrial 
      dysfunction when compared with individuals fully recovered from acute mild 
      COVID-19 (n = 40). Untargeted metabolomic analysis using CE-ESI(+/-)-TOF-MS and 
      GC-Q-MS was performed. Additionally, a lipidomic analysis using 
      LC-ESI(+/-)-QTOF-MS based on an in-house library revealed 447 lipid species 
      identified with a high confidence annotation level. The integration of 
      complementary analytical platforms has allowed a comprehensive metabolic and 
      lipidomic characterization of plasma alterations in Long COVID disease that found 
      46 relevant metabolites which allowed to discriminate between Long COVID and 
      fully recovered patients. We report specific metabolites altered in Long COVID, 
      mainly related to a decrease in the amino acid metabolism and ceramide plasma 
      levels and an increase in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, reinforcing the 
      evidence of an impaired mitochondrial function. The most relevant alterations 
      shown in this study will help to better understand the insights of Long COVID 
      syndrome by providing a deeper knowledge of the metabolomic basis of the 
      pathology.

TI  - Feasibility of a cannabidiol-dominant cannabis-based medicinal product for the 
      treatment of long COVID symptoms: A single-arm open-label feasibility trial.
PG  - 1081-1093
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15988 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To conduct a single-arm open-label feasibility trial of the safety and 
      tolerability of a full-spectrum cannabidiol (CBD)-dominant cannabis-based 
      medicinal product for treating the symptoms of long COVID. METHODS: The treatment 
      phase ran for a total of 21 weeks, followed by ~3 weeks without the study drug. 
      Participants received up to 3 mL of MediCabilis 5% CBD Oil (50 mg CBD/mL, <2 mg 
      δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/mL) per day orally. Monthly patient-reported outcome 
      measures of common symptoms and daily self-report of symptoms were collected via 
      a smartphone app. Key measures of heart rate, activity, sleep and oxygen 
      saturation were assessed using wearable technology. RESULTS: Twelve (1 male, 11 
      female) individuals diagnosed with long COVID were recruited into the trial. All 
      participants adhered to the treatment protocol for the duration of the study and 
      there were no serious adverse events. Response rates for the research assessments 
      were high with over 90% completion of patient-reported outcome measures and daily 
      self-report. CONCLUSION: The study drug was safe and well-tolerated, 
      demonstrating feasibility of CBD-dominant cannabis-based medicinal products in 
      individuals diagnosed with long COVID. However, there were limitations in 
      research design related to recruitment strategy demonstrating a lack of 
      feasibility in the approach implemented in this study. Future work with larger 
      samples and incorporating a control group are required to test the efficacy of 
      this treatment.

TI  - Evaluating PFAS-Induced modulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
      immune response to SARS-CoV-2 spike in COVID-19 Vaccinees.

AB  - The persistent nature of the environmental contaminants per- and polyfluoroalkyl 
      substances (PFAS) has recently received considerable attention, particularly 
      because of their adverse effects on immune system functionality in the context of 
      vaccine responses to infectious diseases. Following COVID-19 vaccination, some 
      studies have shown a significant negative correlation between serum PFAS 
      concentrations and the humoral immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 
      vaccination. However, the influence of PFAS on the cell-mediated immune response 
      to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein post-COVID-19 vaccination remains underexplored. In 
      the present study, we investigated the impact of a human blood-relevant PFAS 
      mixture, containing perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid 
      (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), 
      perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) on innate 
      (monocytes and NK cells), cell-mediated (T cells) and B cells adaptive immune 
      responses in COVID-19-vaccinated female and male healthy donors. Human peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were exposed to a mixture of the six PFAS at real 
      life concentrations and subsequently stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
      peptide. We report a significant upregulation of IFNγ production in T and NK 
      cells, particularly among male donors exposed to high concentrations of the PFAS 
      mixture. Conversely, we observed a decrease in the total B-cell population, 
      particularly among female donors. A significant reduction in the secretion of the 
      pro-inflammatory chemokines MIP-1α (CCL3) and MIP-3α (CCL20) was observed at high 
      PFAS mixture concentrations. Overall, these findings suggest that high PFAS 
      exposure may differentially affect immune responses in a sex-specific manner, 
      with a potential impact on vaccine efficacy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Upper respiratory tract infections, including COVID-19, are 
      associated with olfactory dysfunction and there is a need for novel therapeutic 
      approaches. The aim of study was evaluating the effectiveness of adding 
      melatonin, multivitamin and sodium citrate to olfactory training for the 
      treatment of olfactory loss caused by COVID-19. METHODS: We evaluated olfactory 
      function using University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT ®) 
      scores and self-reported patient outcomes in post-infectious smell loss cases. We 
      investigated the effectiveness involved olfactory training combined with sodium 
      citrate, melatonin, and multivitamin supplements with zinc over a three-month 
      period compared to an olfactory training alone. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients 
      were included, with 33 in each group. There was no significant difference in the 
      proportion of participants who showed improvement in UPSIT scores between the 
      groups (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 0.43-4.8, p =  0.56). Both groups showed improvement in 
      average test scores, but there were no significant differences in self-reported 
      olfactory ability or discomfort with olfactory loss. Qualitative symptoms, such 
      as parosmia and phantosmia, were reported by a similar proportion in both groups 
      before and after the treatment (p =  0.11, p =  1, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Olfactory training alone and olfactory training with associated with melatonin, 
      multivitamins and topical sodium citrate did not show significant differences in 
      improving olfactory function in post-COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Embracing Imatinib: a novel approach to safeguarding the endothelial barrier in 
      patients with COVID-19.
PG  - 481-483
LID - 10.1007/s10456-023-09889-2 [doi]
AB  - Imatinib, an ABL tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, shows promise in restoring 
      endothelial barrier function in patients with COVID-19, thus, preventing cytokine 
      leakage from the alveolar compartment to the systemic compartment. COVID-19 is 
      characterized by an alveolar cytokine storm, and imatinib has been shown to 
      strengthen the endothelial barrier and mitigate alveolar inflammatory responses 
      by modulating NF-κB signaling. Incorporating imatinib into COVID-19 treatment 
      strategies offers a novel approach to safeguard the endothelial barrier and 
      address the complex pathophysiology of the disease, including its potential 
      implications in long COVID. Given that endothelial dysfunction plays a central 
      role in COVID-19 progression and long COVID development, protecting the 
      endothelial barrier during acute infection is crucial in preventing the 
      persistent endothelial dysfunction associated with long COVID.

TI  - D2/D3 Receptor Agonism: Paving the Way for a New Therapeutic Target for Taste 
      Disorders in Parkinson's Disease and Other Conditions?
PG  - 933-935
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyac042 [doi]
AB  - Chemosensory (i.e., olfaction and taste) dysfunction is common in 
      neurodegenerative (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia), 
      psychiatric (e.g., depression, bipolar disorders, other conditions), and 
      postinfectious (i.e., long COVID) diseases and in the elderly. Despite its impact 
      on patients' quality of life, no established treatment for taste disorders exists 
      so far. A recent report on the effect of pramipexole, a D2/D3 agonist, on taste 
      performance in healthy participants provides support for a new potential 
      therapeutic target for taste dysfunction to be tested in future randomized, 
      placebo-controlled, clinical trials across several populations reporting 
      gustatory symptoms.

TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility trends of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi in a

AB  - We conducted a multicenter surveillance study to identify changes in 
      antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Salmonella Typhi and S. Paratyphi in 
      India since the COVID-19 pandemic began. We collected S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi 
      isolates from blood or bone marrow culture-confirmed enteric fever cases at eight 
      sites in seven cities across India between 2021 and 2024. We tested the 
      antibiotic susceptibility of 1150 S. Typhi isolates and 265 S. Paratyphi isolates 
      via disc diffusion and determined their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 
      of ceftriaxone and azithromycin via broth dilution. We identified 18 S. Typhi 
      isolates from Ahmedabad that were resistant to ceftriaxone, indicating a larger 
      emergence of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant S. Typhi in Western India 
      with a novel plasmid profile. Furthermore, we observed yearly increases in the 
      mean, median and 90th percentile of azithromycin MICs for S. Typhi and S. 
      Paratyphi isolates throughout India between 2021 and 2023. Finally, we found that 
      only 0.70% of S. Typhi isolates and 1.13% of S. Paratyphi isolates exhibited 
      susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Our results indicate the necessity for a shift 
      from ciprofloxacin in the treatment of enteric fever, and the importance of 
      implementing long-term monitoring of resistance to alternative antibiotics such 
      as azithromycin and ceftriaxone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We reported a case of multiple sclerosis (MS) with persistent 
      symptomatic COVID-19, which was complicated by new-appearing severe pneumonia 40 
      days after disease onset. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old man with a history of 
      multiple sclerosis referred to our hospital with fever, shaking chills, cough, 
      and dyspnea. In his history, the patient had developed mild COVID-19 from 40 days 
      ago. After 7 days of disease onset, the COVID symptoms had been subsided 
      partially, but fatigue, myalgia, intermittent fever, and loss of taste and smell 
      had been continued. In physical examinations, his oral temperature was 39.4 °C. 
      He had respiratory distress, and his blood oxygen saturation on the room air was 
      90%. The spiral chest CT scan was performed, which revealed bilateral 
      ground-glass and alveolar opacities in favor of COVID-19 pneumonia. The result of 
      the RT-PCR test for SARS-COV-2 was reported positive subsequently. His current MS 
      medication was rituximab and he had received the last dose of rituximab two 
      months before developing COVID-19. The patient was admitted to the COVID ward and 
      put on Remdesivir, subcutaneous interferon-beta1b, and dexamethasone. He improved 
      gradually and was discharged from the hospital with the favorable condition after 
      10 days. This patient had a rare protracted disease course. We presumed that 
      prolonged high degree fever (above 38 °C) in our patient is beyond the diagnosis 
      of the post-COVID-19 syndrome and is more compatible with persistent infection. 
      CONCLUSION: Although most immunocompromised patients effectively clear SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, this case report highlights the risk of persistent infection 
      associated with recurrence of the disease.

AB  - AIM: To study the efficacy and safety of the combined use of thermal heliox 
      (t-He/O(2)), nitric oxide (NO) and molecular hydrogen (H(2)) in patients with 
      exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated by 
      hypoxemic, hypercapnic respiratory failure (RF) and secondary pulmonary arterial 
      hypertension (PAH) in the post-COVID period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      randomized, comparative, controlled, parallel study included patients (n=100, 52 
      men and 48 women) with exacerbation of COPD levels of evidence C and D (GOLD 
      2021-2023) with hypoxemic, hypercapnic respiratory failure and secondary PAH, who 
      had pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 before hospitalization. Patients with similar 
      demographic, clinical, and functional parameters, who received non-invasive 
      ventilation (NIV) and oxygen (O(2)) along with standard drug therapy, were 
      divided into 5 groups: Group 1 (main): (n=22: 12 men, 10 women, who received 
      t-He/O(2), NO, and H(2) sequentially); Group 2 (n=20: 10 men, 10 women, who 
      received t-He/O(2) and NO); Group 3 (n=20: 11 men, 9 women, who received 
      t-He/O(2) and H(2)); Group 4 (n=18: 10 men, 8 women, who received NO and H(2)); 
      Group 5 (control) (n=20: 9 men, 11 women). The dynamics of the clinical condition 
      of patients, gas exchange in the lungs, acid-base balance, left-to-right 
      discharge fraction, hemodynamic parameters, and exercise tolerance were assessed. 
      RESULTS: A positive effect of the complex use of medical gases on the clinical 
      condition of patients, gas exchange parameters in the lungs, metabolism, 
      hemodynamic parameters and exercise tolerance was found in comparison with these 
      parameters in patients who received medical gases separately and with the control 
      group. CONCLUSION: The combination of t-He/O(2), NO and H(2) with simultaneous 
      pathogenetic therapy and NIV in patients with exacerbation of COPD complicated by 
      hypoxemic, hypercapnic RF and secondary PAH in the post-COVID period is safe and 
      more effective compared to groups receiving each medical gas separately. Complex 
      therapy improves the clinical condition of patients, reduces signs of hypoxemia 
      and hypercapnia, vascular endothelial dysfunction, metabolic disorders and 
      increases tolerance to physical activity by normalizing gas exchange in the 
      lungs, increasing oxygen delivery to tissues, reducing the shunt fraction, and 
      restoring metabolism.

TI  - Outcomes of transcutaneous retrobulbar Amphotericin B (TRAMB) as an adjuvant 
      therapy for rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) following COVID-19.
PG  - 1919-1926

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the outcomes of transcutaneous retrobulbar Amphotericin B 
      (TRAMB) for rhino-orbital-cerebral-mucormycosis (ROCM) post-COVID-19, as an 
      adjuvant to standard systemic antifungal therapy. METHODS: In this prospective 
      cohort study involving ROCM patients with clinical/radiological orbital 
      involvement, 44 eyes with ROCM stage ≥ 3B received TRAMB for 7 consecutive days 
      with liposomal Amphotericin-B (3.5 mg/ml) with a minimum clinical and 
      radiological follow-up of 3 months. All patients received standard systemic 
      antifungal therapy also as per institutional protocol. Data pertaining to 
      demography, systemic status, clinical involvement, imaging, surgical/medical 
      management were also recorded. Potential eyes for exenteration were excluded. 
      Please confirm if the author names are presented accurately and in the correct 
      sequence (given name, middle name/initial, family name). Author 12 Given name: 
      [Mahendra Kumar ] Last name [Garg]. Also, kindly confirm the details in the 
      metadata are correct.All author names are presented accurately. Details in the 
      metadata are correct. Thank you. RESULTS: Forty-four eyes of 42 patients were 
      included, out of which 30 had diabetes mellitus & 22 had received steroid/oxygen 
      treatment during COVID-19 infection. Forty eyes showed improvement or stable 
      disease on follow-up on radiology. Four eyes which showed progression of the 
      disease in orbit were reaugmented with TRAMB. No patient required exenteration. 
      Subconjunctival haemorrhage occurred in six eyes and temporary blurring of vision 
      in four eyes after TRAMB which resolved spontaneously. CONCLUSION: TRAMB, as an 
      adjuvant to standard systemic antifungal therapy, is associated with a 
      significant reduction or stabilisation of orbital involvement. TRAMB should be 
      considered as an adjuvant therapy for ROCM to reduce disease progression as well 
      as to preserve globe or sight. It has a promising role in preventing potential 
      orbital exenterations.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 on Drug Positivity Rates in the Emergency Departments in 
      Boston and Surrounding Areas.
PG  - 1064-1070
LID - 10.1093/jalm/jfae076 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic reportedly had a significant impact on drug and 
      alcohol use. In this article, we determine positivity rates for urine drugs of 
      abuse and blood alcohol in 5 emergency departments (ED) in the greater Boston 
      metropolitan area over a 4-year period (pre-, during, and post-COVID-19 
      pandemic). METHODS: Positivity rates for the urine drug screening (UDS) panel and 
      blood alcohol concentration (>80 mg/dL; over the legal limit in MA) were 
      calculated in patients presenting to one of the 5 ED (2 academic hospitals in 
      Boston, MA and 3 community hospitals outside Boston, MA) during each of the 4 
      different time periods: pre-COVID (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019), 
      stay-at-home (March 24, 2020 to May 18, 2020), during COVID (May 19, 2020 to 
      March 28, 2021), and post-COVID (May 12, 2023 to August 31, 2023). Trend analysis 
      was performed. Additionally, positivity rates during and post-COVID were compared 
      to pre-COVID to determine any significant changes in drug positivity. RESULTS: 
      Stimulant (amphetamines and cocaine), cannabinoid, and methadone positivity 
      increased during the pandemic and cocaine, cannabinoid, and methadone positivity 
      remains elevated. By contrast, benzodiazepine and opioid (opiates, fentanyl, 
      oxycodone) positivity decreased and remains lower post-COVID compared to 
      pre-COVID. Patients in the ED with blood alcohol over the legal limit decreased 
      both during and post-COVID. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the COVID-19 
      pandemic significantly affected drug and alcohol positivity rates in patients 
      presenting to the ED in greater Boston area. We encourage other institutions to 
      perform similar analyses to help determine local drug use patterns and 
      appropriate composition of UDS panels.

TI  - Etiological characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and macrolide 
      resistance in children in beijing: a retrospective study from 2018 to 2024.
PG  - 2779-2791
LID - 10.1007/s10096-025-05230-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is a major cause of pediatric respiratory 
      tract infections (RTIs), with recent increases in incidence and macrolide 
      resistance. The epidemiology of MP, macrolide-resistant MP (MRMP), co-infection 
      patterns, and their relationship with disease severity in the post-COVID era 
      remain poorly understood. We analyzed temporal trends in MP infection and MRMP 
      prevalence and assessed their association with severe community-acquired 
      pneumonia (SCAP). METHODS: Children aged < 18 years hospitalized with RTIs at 
      Beijing Children's Hospital were retrospectively enrolled during 2018-2024. 
      Respiratory samples were tested for MP and macrolide resistance mutations. Data 
      on co-infecting bacterial and viral pathogens were collected in clinical practice 
      and retrospectively included in this study. We analyzed temporal trends and risk 
      factors for SCAP. RESULTS: Among 8,453 children, MP-positive patients accounted 
      for 39.7%, declining to 17.0% in 2021 and rising sharply to 62.8% in 2024. The 
      highest MP-positivity rates were seen in children aged 5-9 years, although a 
      notable increase occurred in children aged < 5 years in 2024. MRMP was detected 
      in 96.9% of MP-positive cases, with resistance rates > 95% from 2022. After 2021, 
      co-infections were detected in 19.9% of cases tested for bacterial and viral 
      pathogens, most commonly involving human rhinovirus-MP, Haemophilus 
      influenzae-MP, and Streptococcus pneumoniae-MP. Risk factors for SCAP included 
      female sex, age > 5 years, cold season onset, pure MP infection, and MP 
      co-infection. MRMP was not an independent predictor of SCAP. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      burden of MP infection has resurged post-COVID, with sustained high macrolide 
      resistance and evolving co-infection patterns. Our findings underscore the 
      importance of ongoing surveillance and tailored management strategies for 
      pediatric MP infections.

TI  - AC-73 and Syrosingopine Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Entry into Megakaryocytes by Targeting 
      CD147 and MCT4.
LID - 10.3390/v16010082 [doi]
LID - 82
AB  - Coagulation disorders are described in COVID-19 and long COVID patients. In 
      particular, SARS-CoV-2 infection in megakaryocytes, which are precursors of 
      platelets involved in thrombotic events in COVID-19, long COVID and, in rare 
      cases, in vaccinated individuals, requires further investigation, particularly 
      with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. CD147, involved in the regulation 
      of inflammation and required to fight virus infection, can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 
      entry into megakaryocytes. MCT4, a co-binding protein of CD147 and a key player 
      in the glycolytic metabolism, could also play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
      Here, we investigated the susceptibility of megakaryocytes to SARS-CoV-2 
      infection via CD147 and MCT4. We performed infection of Dami cells and human 
      CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells induced to megakaryocytic differentiation 
      with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in the presence of AC-73 and syrosingopine, 
      respective inhibitors of CD147 and MCT4 and inducers of autophagy, a process 
      essential in megakaryocyte differentiation. Both AC-73 and syrosingopine enhance 
      autophagy during differentiation but only AC-73 enhances megakaryocytic 
      maturation. Importantly, we found that AC-73 or syrosingopine significantly 
      inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of megakaryocytes. Altogether, our data indicate 
      AC-73 and syrosingopine as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection via CD147 and MCT4 
      that can be used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 binding and entry into megakaryocytes, 
      which are precursors of platelets involved in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the autonomic dysfunction of cardiovascular system (CVS) 
      in patients with post-COVID syndrome with the help of active orthotest and heart 
      rate variability methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 70 patients with PCOS were 
      examined, who were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 patients received standard 
      therapy and Cytoflavin for 35 days, Group 2 patients received only standard 
      therapy. Patients were examined by a neurologist in dynamics, the severity of 
      asthenic syndrome was assessed on the MFI-20 scale, HRV and orthostatic test 
      parameters. RESULTS: When assessing HRV, an increase in the activity of humoral 
      and nervous levels of CVS regulation was observed, which decreased against the 
      background of cytoflavin therapy. Prior to the start of treatment, the activity 
      of the parasympathetic department prevailed in patients, despite a decrease in 
      its reactivity. All patients had a change in parasympathetic regulation, and 
      therefore they were divided into subgroups with excessive and insufficient 
      parasympathetic activity. Against the background of therapy, the elimination of 
      differences between the groups with normalization of the main HRV indicators was 
      observed. The severity of asthenia decreased after the course of treatment 
      (values on the MFI-20 scale, p=0.0498). CONCLUSION: In patients with PKS, signs 
      of dysautonomia were revealed, the probable cause of which may be autonomic 
      neuropathy with a predominant lesion of the parasympathetic link. The use of 
      Cytoflavin can have a significant positive effect in the complex treatment of 
      such patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Significant heterogeneity has been reported in cohort studies 
      evaluating the impact of early oral antiviral treatment on preventing postacute 
      sequelae after COVID-19. We evaluated the impact of early nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
      on risk of postacute cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, and autoimmune 
      diagnoses, as well as postacute symptoms amongst older Singaporeans. METHODS: 
      National COVID-19 registries and healthcare claims databases were used to 
      construct a retrospective population-based cohort enrolling all Singaporeans aged 
      ≥60 years diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary care during Omicron 
      transmission (18 March 2022-4 August 2023). The cohort was divided into 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-treated and untreated groups. Between-group differences in 
      baseline characteristics were adjusted using overlap weighting. Risks of 
      postacute cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, and autoimmune diagnoses and 
      postacute symptoms (31-180 days) after SARS-CoV-2 infection were contrasted in 
      treated/untreated groups using competing risks regressions (adjusted for 
      demographics/vaccination status/comorbidities). RESULTS: A total of 188 532 older 
      Singaporeans were included; 5.8% (10 905/188 532) received 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. No significantly decreased risk of postacute sequelae 
      (any sequelae: adjusted hazards ratio [aHR], 1.06; 0.94-1.19; cardiovascular 
      sequelae: aHR, 1.01; 0.83-1.24; neurological sequelae: aHR, 1.09; 0.95-1.27; 
      respiratory sequelae: aHR, 1.14; 0.84-1.55; autoimmune sequelae: aHR, 0.76; 
      0.53-1.09; or any postacute symptom: aHR, 0.97; 0.80-1.18) was observed up to 
      180 days post-infection in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-treated individuals vs. 
      untreated cases. Across all vaccination and age subgroups, no significantly 
      decreased risk of any postacute diagnosis/symptom or any cardiovascular, 
      neurological, respiratory, and autoimmune complications up to 180 days 
      post-infection was observed. DISCUSSION: Early outpatient receipt of 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir did not significantly reduce risk of postacute 
      cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, and autoimmune sequelae or the risk of 
      postacute symptoms in a boosted cohort of older Singaporeans.

PG  - 585-590
LID - 10.1002/npr2.12466 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent cognitive impairment is a serious consequence of the 
      post-COVID condition. However, there have been no established effective 
      treatments for this pathophysiology supported by sufficient evidence. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old woman became aware of difficulty in word recalling, 
      reading, and writing as well as difficulty in completing various household 
      multitasks 3 weeks after the COVID-19 infection. Although blood tests, magnetic 
      resonance imaging, electroencephalography, and Kohs block design test were all 
      within normal limits, completion time by trail making test (TMT) A or B was 
      markedly delayed. Finally, she was referred to our hospital 3 months after the 
      infection. At baseline, the THINC integrated tool (THINC-it), a digital battery 
      consisting of the five-item version of the perceived deficit questionnaire 
      (PDQ-5), choice reaction time (CRT), 1-back test, digit symbol substitution test 
      (DSST), and TMT-B, revealed poor capability in attention, working memory, and 
      executive function. Also, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) demonstrated no 
      activation in frontal or temporal regions during verbal fluency task. 
      Extended-release guanfacine (GXR) 2 mg/day was initiated and a month later was 
      elevated up to 4 mg/day as a maintenance dose. The PDQ-5, CRT, 1-back test, DSST, 
      and TMT-B were dramatically improved 1 month after GXR treatment. NIRS finding 
      was also normalized after 2 months of treatment. These effects were successfully 
      maintained throughout the 6-month follow-up period. CONCLUSION: GXR may be 
      helpful in improving subjective/objective cognitive functioning and 
      frontotemporal brain activity in long-COVID patients manifesting apparent 
      cognitive impairment.

TI  - Investigation into the restoration of TRPM3 ion channel activity in post-COVID-19 
      condition: a potential pharmacotherapeutic target.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recently, we reported that post COVID-19 condition patients also 
      have Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 3 (TRPM3) ion channel dysfunction, a 
      potential biomarker reported in natural killer (NK) cells from Myalgic 
      Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) patients. As there is no 
      universal treatment for post COVID-19 condition, knowledge of ME/CFS may provide 
      advances to investigate therapeutic targets. Naltrexone hydrochloride (NTX) has 
      been demonstrated to be beneficial as a pharmacological intervention for ME/CFS 
      patients and experimental investigations have shown NTX restored TRPM3 function 
      in NK cells. This research aimed to: i) validate impaired TRPM3 ion channel 
      function in post COVID-19 condition patients compared with ME/CFS; and ii) 
      investigate NTX effects on TRPM3 ion channel activity in post COVID-19 condition 
      patients. METHODS: Whole-cell patch-clamp was performed to characterize TRPM3 ion 
      channel activity in freshly isolated NK cells of post COVID-19 condition (N = 9; 
      40.56 ± 11.26 years), ME/CFS (N = 9; 39.33 ± 9.80 years) and healthy controls 
      (HC) (N = 9; 45.22 ± 9.67 years). NTX effects were assessed on post COVID-19 
      condition (N = 9; 40.56 ± 11.26 years) and HC (N = 7; 45.43 ± 10.50 years) where 
      NK cells were incubated for 24 hours in two protocols: treated with 200 µM NTX, 
      or non-treated; TRPM3 channel function was assessed with patch-clamp protocol. 
      RESULTS: This investigation confirmed impaired TRPM3 ion channel function in NK 
      cells from post COVID-19 condition and ME/CFS patients. Importantly, 
      PregS-induced TRPM3 currents were significantly restored in NTX-treated NK cells 
      from post COVID-19 condition compared with HC. Furthermore, the sensitivity of NK 
      cells to ononetin was not significantly different between post COVID-19 condition 
      and HC after treatment with NTX. DISCUSSION: Our findings provide further 
      evidence identifying similarities of TRPM3 ion channel dysfunction between ME/CFS 
      and post COVID-19 condition patients. This study also reports, for the first 
      time, TRPM3 ion channel activity was restored in NK cells isolated from post 
      COVID-19 condition patients after in vitro treatment with NTX. The TRPM3 
      restoration consequently may re-establish TRPM3-dependent calcium (Ca(2+)) 
      influx. This investigation proposes NTX as a potential therapeutic intervention 
      and TRPM3 as a treatment biomarker for post COVID-19 condition.

AB  - On March 2020, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was recommended as a treatment for 
      COVID-19 high risk patients. Following the massive and widespread use of HCQ 
      worldwide, a discernible high quantity is anticipated to end-up through the 
      sewage systems in marine coastal areas. A closed microcosm study was undertaken 
      herein for 30 days where meiobenthic nematodes were exposed to a range of HCQ 
      concentrations (3.162, 31.62 and 63.24 μg.ml(-1)). After one month of exposure in 
      HCQ, the total abundances and Shannon-Wiener index of the assemblages decreased, 
      whereas the individual mass and the Trophic Diversity Index increased at the 
      highest concentrations. Overall, a numerical negative impact was observed for the 
      epistrate feeders and non-selective deposit feeders, however, this benefited to 
      the omnivores-carnivores, and particularly to the Oncholaimids. Such responses of 
      the nematodes 2B and the corresponding taxa are bioindicative of current- or 
      post-COVID-19 crisis risks in relation with the bioaccumulation of HCQ in 
      seafood.

AB  - Background: Post-COVID-19 irritable bowel syndrome (PCIBS) is a frequent finding 
      and is frequently associated with enteral dysbiosis. This pilot study compared 
      the effects of extracts from curcuma and boswellia on PCIBS and irritable bowel

      Methods: A total of 16 subjects with PCIBS and 28 controls with evidence of IBS 
      gastrointestinal symptoms and with enteral dysbiosis were recruited and 
      supplemented for 30 days with sunflower-lecithin-based formulations of extracts 
      of Curcuma longa (500 mg) and Boswellia serrata (150 mg) b.i.d. and with 
      low-FODMAP diet. Abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, enteral dysbiosis (as 
      increased urinary indican), and the global assessment of efficacy (GAE) were 
      evaluated at the end of the study. Results: In both cohorts, intra-cohort changes 
      revealed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduction in bloating and 
      abdominal pain. The GAE showed similar and relevant satisfactory rates in both 
      groups. On the contrary, urinary indican values showed a significant decrease 
      only in the IBS group. Conclusions: Supplementation with Curcuma and Boswellia 
      has favorable effects on abdominal bloating and abdominal pain of subjects with 
      PCIBS and with IBS, while enteral dysbiosis is significantly decreased only in 
      patients with IBS. Additional studies are needed to confirm these preliminary 
      findings and to clarify the reasons for the persistence of dysbiosis in PCIBS.

AB  - Ketamine infusion therapy is increasingly being used as an effective treatment 
      for chronic pain syndromes, including central sensitisation syndrome (CSS) or 
      nociplastic pain. On the contrary, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy 
      (CIPN) is a common but poorly understood condition arising secondary to cancer 
      treatment complications, which poses significant challenges in its management due 
      to limited therapeutic options. We present a case of a man in his 60s with 
      chronic CIPN, later complicated by CSS and post-COVID-19 symptoms treated with a 
      multiday subanaesthetic ketamine infusion, resulting in a clinically significant 
      and sustained long-term improvement in function and pain control, for pain due to 
      CSS and CIPN.This case highlights the use of multiday ketamine infusion therapy 
      for the management of CSS and post-COVID-19 symptoms in a patient with 
      well-documented severe treatment refractory CIPN. It demonstrates the growing 
      evidence for ketamine as an analgesic agent for chronic pain, with potential 
      considerations to expand its use for other indications. His response to ketamine 
      infusion may implicate the possibility of a unifying mechanism in patients with 
      nociplastic pain or CSS, post- COVID-19 symptoms and chronic CIPN.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in 777 million 
      confirmed cases and over 7 million deaths worldwide, with insufficient treatment 
      options. Innumerable efforts are being made around the world for faster 
      identification of therapeutic agents to treat the deadly disease. Post Acute 
      Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 (PASC), also called Long COVID, is 
      still being understood and lacks treatment options as well. A growing list of 
      drugs are being suggested by various in silico, in vitro and ex vivo models, 
      however currently only two treatment options are widely used: the RNA-dependent 
      RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor remdesivir, and the main protease inhibitor 
      nirmatrelvir in combination with ritonavir. Computational drug development tools 
      and in silico studies involving molecular docking, molecular dynamics, entropy 
      calculations and pharmacokinetics can be useful to identify new targets to treat 
      COVID-19 and PASC, as shown in this work and our recent paper that identified 
      alendronate as a promising candidate. In this study, we have investigated all 
      bisphosphonates (BPs) on the ChEMBL database which can bind competitively to 
      nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyl (NiRAN) transferase domain, and 
      systematically down selected seven candidates (CHEMBL608526, CHEMBL196676, 
      CHEMBL164344, CHEMBL4291724, CHEMBL4569308, CHEMBL387132, CHEMBL98211), two of 
      which closely resemble the approved drugs minodronate and zoledronate. This work 
      and our recent paper together provide an in silico mechanistic explanation for 
      alendronate and zoledronate users having dramatically reduced odds of SARS-CoV-2 
      testing, COVID-19 diagnosis, and COVID-19-related hospitalizations, and indicate 
      that similar observational studies in Japan with minodronate could be valuable.

AB  - The persistent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates novel antiviral strategies. 
      This study evaluated the anti-HIV prodrugs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 
      and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) for repurposing against SARS-CoV-2, assessing key 
      pharmacological indices (CC(50), EC(50), cytostatic effect, and therapeutic 
      window). In vitro screening in Vero E6 cells measured cytotoxicity (via CCK-8/MTT 
      assays) and antiviral activity against Kazakh B.1 and Wuhan strains. TDF (50 
      µg/mL) reduced high viral loads (MOI 2) by ~2 log(10) (100% inhibition), with 
      minimal cytotoxicity (≥75% viability). TAF achieved near-complete suppression 
      (100% inhibition) at 50 µg/mL, exhibiting dose-dependent inhibition (68-100%) at 
      lower viral loads (MOI 0.01). Both prodrugs showed enhanced antiviral activity 
      with prolonged exposure (96 h). Synergy assessments demonstrated favourable 
      combination indices (CI < 1). Electron microscopy confirmed virion integrity 
      post-treatment. These findings highlight TDF and TAF as promising candidates 
      against SARS-CoV-2, with particular potential for targeting lymphoid 
      reservoirs-sites implicated in persistent viral reservoirs that may contribute to 
      long COVID pathogenesis. Further clinical validation is warranted.

AB  - Introduction Preclinically, fluvoxamine and other antidepressants (AD) exerted 
      antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties also against SARS-COV-2. Therfore, It 
      makes sense to test the clinical effect of AD against COVID-19 and Long COVID. 
      METHODS: On May 20, 2024, this systematic scoping review in PUBMED identified 
      1016 articles related to AD and COVID-19, Long COVID and SARS-COV-2. These 
      included 10 retrospective "large scale" studies (> 20000 chart reviews), 8 
      prospective clinical trials (plus 4 regarding Long COVID), 11 placebo-controlled 
      randomized (RCT) (plus 2 regarding Long COVID) and 15 meta-analyses. RESULTS: 
      COVID-19: Retrospective studies with cohorts taking AD primarily for psychiatric 
      comorbidities or chronic pain conditions directly prior to SARS-COV-2 infection 
      described that this substance class (most studied: Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake 
      Inhibitors (SSRI) and Selective Serotonin Noradrenaline Re-Uptake Inhibitors 
      (SSNRI)) were associated with (i) significantly fewer SARS-COV-2 infections and 
      (ii) a milder course of COVID-19 ("COVID-19 protection"). Ten of the 11 RCTs 
      found regarding COVID-19 tested fluvoxamine, as this old AD appeared suitable as 
      a prophylactic agent against severe COVID-19, taking into account its in vitro 
      potency against the progression of intracellular sepsis cascades. Therefore, most 
      (12 out of 15) meta-analyses also referred to fluvoxamine. They found (iii) a 
      significant (40-70% reduction) in mortality, intubation and hospitalization rates 
      when fluvoxamine was used as an add-on to standard therapy for mild to moderate 
      COVID-19. When this AD was used in the early stages of the disease, it was more 
      successful than when it was given later in advanced, severe COVID-19 (e.g. severe 
      pneumonia, final sepsis stages). A dose dependency was observed: 2x50 mg 
      fluvoxamine over 15 days was less effective than 2x100 or even 3x100 mg with an 
      adverse event profile still at the placebo level. Direct comparisons with drugs 
      approved for COVID-19 do not yet exist. A first indirect meta-analytical 
      comparison showed an advantage of paxlovid or molnupiravir versus fluvoxamine 
      against the development of severe COVID-19: risk reduction of 95% (I2 = N/A, but 
      only one study) or 78% (I2=0) versus 5+-5% (I2=48). However, an add-on of 
      fluvoxamine was still significantly more efficacious than symptom-oriented 
      standard therapy alone. Long COVID: A common Long COVID phenotype with dominant 
      anxiety and depression symptoms, which responds to AD, relaxation therapy and/or 
      psychotherapy, has now been identified. Casuistics report positive effects of AD 
      on fatigue, cognitive and autonomic dysfunctions. A first large prospective 
      open-label RCT has just shown significantly more favourable courses, less viral 
      load and less pro-inflammatory cytokines in the treatment of mild to moderate 
      COVID-19 with fluvoxamine versus standard treatment, also with regard to the 
      subsequent development of neuropsychiatric and pulmonary Long COVID or fatigue. 
      CONCLUSION: Overall, there is promising evidence of a preventive effect of AD 
      (especially fluvoxamine) against progression to severe COVID-19 and against the 
      development of Long COVID. It is likely, that the entire AD substance class could 
      be effective here. This assumption is based on the results of retrospective large 
      scale studies, but awaits verification by better controlled studies. The 
      potential effectiveness/efficacy (currently low and moderate confidence of the 
      evidence for the entire substance class and specifically fluvoxamine, 
      respectively) of fluvoxamine as an add-on against COVID-19 and possibly also 
      directly against Long COVID could stimulate similar projects in other infectious 
      diseases that also have the potential to pose a lasting threat to the health of 
      those affected. We consider the evidence to date to be sufficient to be able to 
      emphasize a possible positive effect of these substances in the psychoeducation 
      of patients with COVID-19 or Long COVID who are already receiving AD for other 
      conditions - especially also against the symptoms associated with the viral 
      disease or its consequences. In regions where neither vaccines nor antiviral 
      agents currently approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 are 
      available, AD and in particular fluvoxamine would be a cost-effective alternative 
      to protect against a severe course, even if this AD appears to have a smaller 
      effect against COVID-19 than the currently approved antiviral agents, but with 
      presumably better tolerability. A direct comparative clinical trial with approved 
      antiviral agents is still pending and should be positive to further open the door 
      for a guideline-based recommendation of fluvoxamine (or perhaps even AD) for 
      COVID-19 or its aftermath.

      Widespread Rhinocerebral Mucormycosis and Pneumonia: A Case Report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a unique challenge to the medical 
      community due to potential co-infections with bacteria and fungi. We report a 
      case of Rhino cerebral mucormycosis infection in a 67-year-old patient after 
      recovery from COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of Rhino cerebral 
      mucormycosis in a 67-year-old patient with preexisting health conditions after 
      recovering from COVID-19 and to highlight the importance of early detection and 
      treatment of co-infections in patients with pre-existing health conditions. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: The patient had pre-existing health conditions, including 
      uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD), which made him more vulnerable to complications after COVID-19. He was 
      admitted to the hospital after experiencing a dark discharge from his left eye, 
      later confirmed to be due to mucormycosis. Histopathological examination revealed 
      invasive mucormycosis, highlighting the importance of early detection and 
      treatment. However, the patient experienced Acute kidney injury (AKI) after only 
      5 days of treatment with conventional amphotericin B, underscoring the need for 
      careful monitoring and adjustment of treatment regimens. DISCUSSION: The case 
      underscores the need for early detection and treatment of co-infections in 
      vulnerable patients. The patient's pre-existing conditions and immunocompromised 
      state made him more susceptible to the infection. The case also highlights the 
      importance of careful monitoring and adjustment of treatment regimens to minimize 
      the risk of adverse effects. CONCLUSION: While COVID-19 has presented challenges 
      and uncertainties, it has also provided valuable insights into the interactions 
      between infectious agents and the human body. Continued research and vigilance 
      are necessary to mitigate the impact of co-infections and improve outcomes for 
      patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Astragalus root extract on 
      nurses suffering from post-COVID-19 chronic fatigue syndrome. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The study was designed as a triple-blind, randomised, controlled trial 
      in Iran in 2023. 64 chronic fatigue syndrome nurses were randomly assigned to one 
      of two groups: an intervention group (n=32) that received Astragalus root extract 
      (500 mg two times per day) or a control group (n=32) that received a placebo. 
      Changes in chronic fatigue syndrome scores were measured before to, at the end of 
      and 1 month after the intervention. Data were analysed using descriptive and 
      analytical statistics (T-tests, χ(2), analysis of variances, Cochran's Q tests, 
      McNemar and generalised estimating equations). RESULTS: In comparison to before, 
      chronic fatigue prevalence decreased statistically significantly at the end of 
      the intervention group (13.8%) and 1 month later (17.2%). Further, the frequency 
      differed between before and after (p=0.0001) and 1 month later (p=0.0001). In the 
      control group, chronic fatigue was statistically significantly different before 
      and after the intervention (72.2%; p=0.003). Having an underlying disease 
      (B=0.84, OR=2.33; p=0.04) and being in the control group (B=2.15, OR=12.36; 
      p=0.01) increased the risk of chronic fatigue, whereas increasing the length of 
      time decreased it (B=-0.67, OR=0.50; p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: Astragalus root 
      extract has been shown to reduce chronic fatigue in nurses. Therefore, this 
      herbal extract can be used to reduce the incidence and treatment of chronic 
      fatigue in nurses.

AB  - The use of healthcare products containing triclosan has surged globally due to 
      the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we used a global spatially explicit model 
      to simulate triclosan export by rivers to coastal seas in the post-COVID-19 era. 
      The global triclosan model shows that the primary watersheds of triclosan export 
      in Europe, Africa, Southeast Asia, United States, Brazil, India, and China, with 
      river mouths presenting higher ecological risk distributed in Europe, South Asia, 
      and America. It is estimated that triclosan concentrations in more than 77 % of 
      global watersheds will be below the toxicity threshold by 2030 if the per capita 
      use of triclosan is halved. Rather than completely restricting the use of

AB  - Combined treatments against SARS-CoV-2 are emerging and some have taken into 
      account the post-COVID-19 fibrosis. The aim of this survey was to report the 
      experience of treating COVID-19 patients with pirfenidone, nitazoxanide (NTZ) and 
      colchicine. It was a case series report of COVID-19 patients treated from 
      December 2020 to March 2021, in a rural health center located in the State of 
      Mexico, Mexico. 23 patients were included (mean age 44.5 ± 17.1 years), 12 women 
      (mean age 45.9 ± 17.9 years) and 11 men (mean age 43 ± 16.9 years) with four 
      deaths (17.39%). The evolution time was of 17.3 ± 6.7 days being the main 
      symptoms fever (82.6%), myalgia (69.6%) and cough (65.2%). The main comorbidities 
      were overweight/obesity 18 (78.26%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 4 (17.39%), 
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 5 (21.73%) and systemic hypertension 
      2 (8.69%). Two patients were intubated and both died; in these cases, they 
      refused to take NTZ until after three days the medical doctor had prescribed it 
      for the first time. It can be concluded that implementing a mixed treatment with 
      pirfenidone, NTZ and colchicine could improve the survival rate in ambulatory 
      patients of low socioeconomic status.

LID - 10.1159/000546399 [doi]
AB  - <p>Objectives: The overexpression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) 
      was frequently observed during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and it was 
      found to be closely associated with disease severity. We have analyzed the PAI-1 
      status in fully recovered post-COVID patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a 
      case-control and cross-sectional study, we compared 377 patients, 30-210 days 
      after PCR-verified COVID-19 and 884 COVID-naive controls. RESULTS: Post-COVID 
      patients ("cases") showed significantly higher plasma PAI-1 concentrations than 
      COVID-naive controls. This difference remained significant even after complex 
      adjustment by multiple regression. On the other hand, since the strongest 
      covariate of increased PAI-1 was antihypertensive treatment, the difference 
      between cases and controls in those who were on antihypertensives completely 
      disappeared. In the subgroup of post-COVID patients only, we also found that 
      highly symptomatic patients or those who required hospitalization in the acute 
      phase showed significantly higher PAI-1 than patients with only mild symptoms of 
      the disease. Similarly, the presence of β mutation increased the relative risk 
      (≈11 times) of high post-COVID concentrations of PAI-1. Similarly, the presence 
      of β mutation increased the relative risk (≈11 times) of high post-COVID 
      concentrations of PAI-1. CONCLUSIONS: Increased values of PAI-1 can persist for 
      several months after complete recovery from COVID-19 (namely, by β variant of the 
      virus), and their expression also corresponded to clinical course of the disease.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report a case of BADI post Covid infection following systemic 
      moxifloxacin therapy. METHODS: Observational case study. CASE REPORT: A 
      28-year-old female presented to us with complaints of redness and pain in the 
      right eye since 5 days. History revealed use of systemic moxifloxacin for covid 
      infection. She was managed with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics 
      following a diagnosis of BADI. CONCLUSION: Bilateral acute depigmentation of iris 
      (BADI) is a rare disease entity associated with the release of iris pigments. 
      Various underlying aetiologies have been associated with the same. Although BADI 
      is a benign, self-limiting disorder, it needs to be differentiated with other 
      potential severe clinical entities. SARS-CoV2 has been associated with various 
      ocular manifestations. However, to the best of our knowledge, BADI has never been 
      associated with COVID infection yet. We report a case of BADI in a young healthy 
      Asian middle - aged female 3 months after an acute COVID infection.

      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 69

LID - 69
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between plasma lipids, nitric oxide (NO) and 
      cardiovascular risk has been well documented in the literature, however, the 
      association between these outcomes and heart rate variability (HRV) in COVID-19 
      remains incipient as there is no scientific evidence that has investigated this 
      outcome. OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether metabolic outcomes may be associated with 
      cardiac autonomic behavior arising from short-term HRV variables in 
      non-hospitalized mild post-COVID individuals. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional 
      study. Individuals of both sexes, aged ≥ 18 years, who tested positive for 
      SARS-CoV-2 according to the RT-PCR test, without the need for hospitalization, 
      were included. The HRV was collected in the supine position for at least 10 min 
      for later analysis in the Kubios software. Metabolic outcomes [high density 
      lipoprotein (HDL) (mg/dL), cholesterol (mg/dL), triglycerides (mg/dL) and NO 
      (µmol/L)] were collected through a blood sample. RESULTS: Seventy-three 
      individuals were included (post-COVID = 32; control = 41). HRV was worse in the 
      post-COVID group when compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Cholesterol, HDL, 
      triglycerides and NO showed significant correlations with HRV indices. Regression 
      models indicated that cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as NO, explain up to 
      30.3% of the variations in certain HRV indices, suggesting an impact of metabolic 
      outcomes on autonomic modulation. CONCLUSION: There is a relationship between 
      plasma lipids, NO and HRV in non-hospitalized individuals with mild COVID-19. 
      Metabolic outcomes are associated and explain between 16.6% and 30.30% of certain 
      variables of resting HRV in post-COVID individuals. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not 
      applicable.

TI  - State sequence analysis of daily methadone dispensing trajectories among 
      individuals at United States opioid treatment programs before and following 
      COVID-19 onset.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: US regulatory changes allowed for additional methadone 
      take-home doses following COVID-19 onset. How dispensing practices changed and 
      which factors drove variation remains unexplored. We determined daily methadone 
      dispensing trajectories over six months before and after regulatory changes due 
      to COVID-19 using state sequence analysis and explored correlates. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective chart review of electronic health records. SETTINGS: Nine opioid 
      treatment programs (OTPs) across nine US states. PARTICIPANTS: Adults initiating 
      treatment in 2019 (n = 328) vs. initiating 1 month after the COVID-19 regulatory 
      changes of March 2020 (n = 376). MEASUREMENTS: Type of daily methadone medication 
      encounter (in-clinic, weekend/holiday take-home, take-home, missed dose, 
      discontinued) based on OTP clinic; cohort (pre vs. post-COVID-19); and patient 
      substance use, clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. FINDINGS: Following 
      COVID-19 regulatory changes, allotted methadone take-home doses increased from 
      3.5% to 13.8% of total person-days in treatment within the first 6 months in 
      care. Clinic site accounted for the greatest variation in methadone dispensing 
      (6.2% and 9.5% of the variation of discrepancy between sequences pre- and 
      post-COVID-19, respectively). People who co-use methamphetamine had a greater 
      increase in take-homes than people who did not use methamphetamine (from 3.7% 
      pre-pandemic to 21.2% post-pandemic vs. 3.5% to 12.5%) and higher discontinuation 
      (average 3.6 vs. 4.7 months among people who did not use methamphetamine 
      pre-COVID-19; average 3.3 vs. 4.6 months post-COVID-19). In the post-COVID-19 
      cohort, females had a higher proportion of missed doses (17.2% vs. 11.9%) than 
      males. People experiencing houselessness had a higher proportion of missed doses 
      (19% vs. 12.3%) and shorter stays (average 3.5 vs. 4.5 months) when compared with 
      those with stable housing. CONCLUSION: Daily methadone dispensing trajectories in 
      the US both before and following COVID-19 regulatory changes appeared to depend 
      more on the opioid treatment programs' practices than individual patient 
      characteristics or response to treatment.

TI  - Neuroinflammation in long COVID: the role of the Val16Ala polymorphism of SOD2 
      and cognitive impairment.

AB  - Long COVID (LC) includes persistent behavioral and cognitive deficits, impacting 
      quality of life. Neuroinflammation plays a key role in these alterations, with 
      genetic factors influencing susceptibility. The MnSOD Val16Ala SNP is associated 
      with neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction, but its role in LC remains 
      unclear. This study investigated the relationship between the SOD2 Val16Ala 
      polymorphism and neurocognitive alterations in young adults post-SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. Neurocognitive performance was assessed using the Neupsilin test in 
      individuals with and without prior COVID-19. Blood samples were collected for the 
      quantification of cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) and for the genotyping 
      of the SOD2 Val16Ala polymorphism. The COVID-19 group showed worse cognitive 
      performance and higher cytokine levels than controls, particularly in memory and 
      executive function. Val allele carriers (Val/Ala and Val/Val) exhibited increased 
      pro-inflammatory cytokine levels compared to Ala/Ala carriers. These findings 
      suggest a potential interaction between genetic susceptibility and inflammatory 
      response in post-COVID neurocognitive alterations. Young adults post-COVID-19 
      presented an exacerbated neuroinflammatory response, likely influencing 
      cognition. The presence of the Val allele was associated with greater 
      susceptibility to inflammatory events, suggesting a genetic component in 
      LC-related neurological dysfunction. These results reinforce the role of 
      neuroinflammation in LC and highlight the importance of genetic factors in 
      determining cognitive outcomes. Understanding these mechanisms may help identify 
      individuals at higher risk and support future therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the rise of long 
      COVID, characterized by persistent respiratory and cognitive dysfunctions, has 
      become a significant health concern. This leads to an increased role of 
      complementary and alternative medicine in addressing this condition. However, our 
      comprehension of the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicines for long COVID 
      remains limited. Here, we present a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) 
      dataset of peripheral whole blood cells derived from participants in a clinical 
      study involving three commercially available herbal medicines, targeting fatigue 
      and brain fog in long COVID. The dataset comprises 181,205 quality control 
      (QC)-passed cells, along with clinical metadata, enabling a comparative analysis 
      of immune cell populations before and after treatment. To ensure the technical 
      validity of our dataset, we implemented rigorous quality checks throughout stages 
      of the study, including sample preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatic data 
      analysis levels. This transcriptomic data may serve as a resource to deepen our 
      insights into the role of herbal medicines in management of long COVID.

TI  - Increased Levels of Inflammatory and Endothelial Biomarkers in Blood of Long 
      COVID Patients Point to Thrombotic Endothelialitis.
PG  - 288-294
LID - 10.1055/s-0043-1769014 [doi]
AB  - The prevailing hypotheses for the persistent symptoms of Long COVID have been 
      narrowed down to immune dysregulation and autoantibodies, widespread organ 
      damage, viral persistence, and fibrinaloid microclots (entrapping numerous 
      inflammatory molecules) together with platelet hyperactivation. Here we 
      demonstrate significantly increased concentrations of von Willebrand factor 
      (VWF), platelet factor 4 (PF4), serum amyloid A (SAA), α-2 antiplasmin (α-2AP), 
      endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (E-selectin), and platelet endothelial 
      cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) in the soluble part of the blood. It was 
      noteworthy that the mean level of α-2 antiplasmin exceeded the upper limit of the 
      laboratory reference range in Long COVID patients, and the other 5 were 
      significantly elevated in Long COVID patients as compared to the controls. This 
      is alarming if we take into consideration that a significant amount of the total 
      burden of these inflammatory molecules has previously been shown to be entrapped 
      inside fibrinolysis-resistant microclots (thus decreasing the apparent level of 
      the soluble molecules). We conclude that presence of microclotting, together with 
      relatively high levels of six biomarkers known to be key drivers of endothelial 
      and clotting pathology, points to thrombotic endothelialitis as a key 
      pathological process in Long COVID.

TI  - Exhaled breath-based clusters in children with post-COVID condition.
LID - 10.1088/1752-7163/ae33e1 [doi]
AB  - Pediatric post-COVID condition (PPCC) presents as a heterogeneous disease with a 
      broad spectrum of symptoms. This study aimed to identify distinct phenotypes of 
      PPCC through an unbiased cluster analysis of exhaled metabolites, with the goal 
      of identifying biomarkers to stratify patients. Exhaled breath samples were 
      collected from children with physician-diagnosed PPCC. An unsupervised clustering 
      approach was applied to the exhaled breath metabolites, and the resulting 
      clusters were compared with clinical variables. Sparse partial least 
      squares-discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) was applied to find most discriminative 
      metabolites between clusters. A total of 54 children were included and 
      categorized into two clusters. Compared to Cluster 1 (n= 38), Cluster 2 (n= 16) 
      consisted predominantly of older girls (69%) with a median age of 16 years and 
      exhibited more severe PPCC-related outcomes, including higher PROMIS fatigue 
      scores. Six volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified as biomarkers that 
      effectively differentiated the two clusters. These VOCs, previously reported in 
      the literature, highlight metabolic and inflammatory disruptions and demonstrated 
      high discriminatory performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve (AUROCC) = 1). This study found two distinct phenotypes of PPCC, and 
      identified six discriminating VOCs, underscoring the potential of VOCs as 
      non-invasive biomarkers for disease stratification in PPCC. While it could be a 
      building block towards a better understanding of the metabolic disruptions 
      underlying PPCC, further research with larger patient cohorts is necessary to 
      elucidate the mechanisms driving these differences.

TI  - Effect of Ficus pumila L. on Improving Insulin Secretory Capacity and Resistance 
      in Elderly Patients Aged 80 Years Old or Older Who Develop Diabetes After 
      COVID-19 Infection.
LID - 10.3390/nu17020290 [doi]
LID - 290
AB  - (1) Background: It has been reported that people affected by COVID-19, an 
      infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, suffer from various diseases, after 
      infection. One of the most serious problems is the increased risk of developing 
      diabetes after COVID-19 infection. However, a treatment for post-COVID-19 
      infection diabetes has not yet been established. In this study, we investigated 
      the effects of Ficus pumila L. extract, which has traditionally been used to 
      reduce blood glucose levels in Okinawa, on patients who developed diabetes after 
      COVID-19 infection. (2) Methods: In total, 128 rehabilitation patients aged 80 
      years old or older who developed diabetes after COVID-19 infection were included. 
      The HOMA-β (Homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function) and HOMA-IR 
      (Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance) were assessed to evaluate 
      the glucose tolerance. (3) Results: The HOMA-β decreased and HOMA-IR increased in 
      patients who developed after diabetes after COVID-19 infection. Subsequently, 59 
      patients were given Ficus pumila L. extract and their HOMA-β and HOMA-IR improved 
      after ingestion. On the other hand, the control group of patients who did not 
      consume Ficus pumila L. showed no improvement in both HOMA-β and HOMA-IR. (4) 
      Conclusions: Ficus pumila L. extract, ingested by patients who developed diabetes 
      after COVID-19 infection, stimulated insulin secretion capacity and improved 
      insulin resistance.

TI  - Unmasking Bartonella henselae infection in the shadows of long COVID thanks to 
      clinical metagenomics.
PG  - 1025-1029
LID - 10.1007/s10096-024-04801-2 [doi]
AB  - The diagnosis of long COVID often relies on symptoms post-COVID-19, occasionally 
      lacking biological evidence. This case study illustrates how investigating long 
      COVID uncovered an underlying bartonellosis through clinical metagenomics. 
      Following mild COVID-19, a 26-year-old woman experienced persistent symptoms 
      during 5 months, including axillary adenopathy. Pathological examination, 16 S 
      rRNA PCR, and clinical metagenomic analysis were done on an adenopathy biopsy. 
      The latter revealed Bartonella henselae DNA and RNA. Treatment with 
      clarithromycin improved symptoms. This case underscores the relevance of clinical 
      metagenomics in diagnosing hidden infections. Post-COVID symptoms warrant 
      thorough investigation, and bartonellosis should be considered in polyadenopathy 
      cases, regardless of a recent history of cat or flea exposures.

TI  - Post-COVID-19 Painless Thyroiditis: A Case Study on Thyrotoxicosis Management.
PG  - e948356
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.948356 [doi]
LID - e948356
AB  - BACKGROUND Painless thyroiditis is a rare variant of thyroiditis characterized by 
      low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and normal or elevated T4 
      concentrations, without clinical signs of acute inflammation. While thyroiditis, 
      including subacute and atypical forms, has been associated with many viral 
      infections including SARS-CoV-2, the occurrence of painless thyroiditis after 
      acute COVID-19 remains uncommon. CASE REPORT We describe the case of a 
      67-year-old man with history of hypertension, diabetes, and myocardial infarction 
      who presented with a 4-week history of decreased appetite, nausea, weight loss, 
      and upper-extremity tremors. He reported having a resolved case of COVID-19 2 
      months previously. Laboratory evaluation revealed a low TSH level (0.01 mIU/L) 
      and elevated free T4 (>7.7 µg/dL), with negative thyroid-stimulating and thyroid 
      peroxidase antibodies. A neck ultrasound showed a normal thyroid gland. The 
      patient was diagnosed with post-COVID-19 painless thyroiditis and managed with 
      beta blockers, methimazole, and corticosteroids. His symptoms improved 
      significantly during hospitalization, and he was discharged with follow-up plans 
      to monitor for potential hypothyroidism. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the 
      importance of considering post-COVID-19 painless thyroiditis in patients 
      presenting with thyrotoxicosis and a history of COVID-19. Prompt recognition and 
      treatment with beta blockers, anti-thyroid drugs, and corticosteroids can lead to 
      symptom resolution. Regular follow-up is crucial to detect and manage potential 
      long-term thyroid dysfunction.

TI  - Clinical effects of traditional Chinese herbal medicine management in patients 
      with COVID-19 sequelae: A hospital-based retrospective cohort study in Taiwan.
PG  - 1280-1291
LID - 10.7150/ijms.96575 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: An estimated 43% of COVID-19 patients showed sequelae, including 
      fatigue, neurocognitive impairment, respiratory symptoms, and smell or taste 
      disorders. These sequelae significantly affect an individual's health, work 
      capacity, healthcare systems, and socioeconomic aspects. Traditional Chinese 
      herbal medicine (TCHM) management showed clinical benefits in treating patients 
      with COVID-19 sequelae. This study aimed to analyze the effects of personalized 
      TCHM management in patients with COVID-19 sequelae. Methods: After the COVID-19 
      outbreak in Taiwan, we recorded Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment 
      Tool (CAT), Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ-11), and Brief Symptom Rating 
      Scale (BSRS-5) to assess post-COVID respiratory, fatigue, and emotional distress 
      symptoms, respectively. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the medical 
      records between July 2022 and March 2023. We analyzed the effects of TCHM 
      administration after 14- and 28-days of treatment. Results: 47 patients were 
      included in this study. The results demonstrated that personalized TCHM treatment 
      significantly improved the CAT, CFQ-11, and BSRS-5 scores after 14 and 28 days. 
      TCHM alleviated physical and psychological fatigue. In logistic regression 
      analysis, there was no statistically significant differences in the severity of 
      the baseline symptoms and TCHM administration effects concerning the duration 
      since the initial confirmation of COVID-19, sex, age, or dietary preference 
      (non-vegetarian or vegetarian). Conclusions: Our study suggested that 
      personalized TCHM treatment notably reduced fatigue, respiratory and emotional 
      distress symptoms after 14- and 28-days of treatment in patients with COVID-19 
      sequelae. We propose that TCHM should be considered as an effective intervention 
      for patients with COVID-19 sequelae.

TI  - Trends in the hand hygiene practices using alcohol-based hand rubs in Japanese 
      hospitals before and after the novel coronavirus pandemic: an observational study 
      using national surveillance data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a global concern in 
      healthcare facilities, and hand hygiene (HH) using alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHR) 
      is fundamentally crucial for their prevention. While previous studies report 
      improvements in HH compliance amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the real situation in 
      Japanese medical settings remains unclear. METHODS: This observational study 
      sought data from the Japanese national surveillance, focusing on ABHR use in 
      hospitals before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were retrieved from 
      facilities certified to receive the Additional Healthcare Reimbursements for 
      Infection Prevention and Control I. The study spanned five years (2019-2023), 
      segmented quarterly, and employed Joinpoint regression analysis to assess the 
      annual percentage change (APC). RESULTS: Overall, ABHR use per patient per day 
      significantly increased both in critical care units and general wards amid the 
      pandemic. However, the APC in the critical care units demonstrated a downward 
      trend from Q4 of 2021 to Q1 of 2023, and ABHR use in general wards remained below 
      the amount of WHO recommendations. CONCLUSION: This trend analysis highlighted 
      recent patterns of ABHR use in Japanese hospitals by comparing pre- and 
      post-COVID-19 periods. Although increases in ABHR use were observed over time, 
      sustained efforts to promote HH compliance are necessary, particularly in general 
      wards.

AB  - At the end of March 2020, ivermectin was confirmed as a drug for COVID-19 
      treatment. A significant amount of ivermectin could deposit into sediments of the 
      semi-closed Mediterranean Sea, where three European COVID-19 epicenters are 
      located: Italy, Spain, and France. Meiobenthic nematodes were exposed to three 
      ivermectin doses (1.8 ng.g(-1), 9 ng.g(-1), and 18 ng.g(-1)) for 10 days. 
      Ivermectin caused a great reduction in abundance. However, the diversity indices 
      decreased only at high doses. Ivermectin disadvantaged the 1B-Cr-Id functional 
      type (non-selective deposit feeders and nematodes with circular or indistinct 
      amphids) and benefited the 2A-REL-Sp type (epistrate feeders and nematodes with 
      rounded or elongated loop amphids). Thus, Trophic Diversity and Amphideal 
      Diversity index values increased with sedimentary ivermectin enrichment. Large 
      amphideal foveas were more efficient for 2A-REL-Sp nematodes to avoid ivermectin. 
      The responses of the functional type 2A-REL-Sp and corresponding taxa predict 
      post-COVID-19 environmental concerns and the bioaccumulation of ivermectin in 
      seafoods.

TI  - Therapeutic effect of anti-neuroinflammatory supplement combined with olfactory 
      training on post-covid olfactory dysfunction: a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s00405-026-10013-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no established specific treatment for post-COVID olfactory 
      dysfunction (PCOD) currently. Olfactory training (OT) is the only effective 
      intervention supported by clinical evidence. The anti-neuroinflammatory 
      supplement palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin (PEA-LUT) has shown potential in 
      alleviating the symptoms of post-COVID, but its therapeutic effect on olfactory 
      dysfunction and the gain effect when combined with OT remain to be evaluated. 
      METHODS: We comprehensively searched the online databases EMBASE, PubMed, 
      ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and 
      ClinicalTrials.govfor the literature related to the treatment of PCOD, identified 
      studies reporting the efficacy of PEA-LUT combined with OT, extracted the 
      treatment outcome data, and performed data synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 7 
      eligible RCTs published between 2021 and 2024 were included, comprising 525 
      patients with PCOD. Of the seven studies, five (71.4%) used the full 
      Threshold-Discrimination-Identification (TDI) scoresystem to assess olfactory 
      function, while two (28.6%) used only the Identification ("I") subscale; 332 
      patients (63.2%) received PEA-LUT + OT therapy and 203 (38.8%) received OT alone. 
      Meta-analysis of these studies showed that patients receiving PEA-LUT combined 
      with OT had significantly higher TDI scores compared to those receiving OT alone 
      (Standard mean difference (SMD) = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.24-1.58; P < 0.01). The overall 
      response rate was also significantly higher in the combination group (Risk 
      difference (RD) = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.01-0.64; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The 
      neuroprotective properties of PEA-LUT appear to enhance recovery from post-COVID 
      olfactory dysfunction. When combined with olfactory training, this treatment 
      shows promising potential as a novel therapeutic approach.

TI  - Targeting mevalonate pathway by zoledronate ameliorated pulmonary fibrosis in a 
      rat model: Promising therapy against post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 703-717
LID - 10.1111/fcp.12994 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway plays a critical role in post-COVID-19 
      pulmonary fibrosis (PCPF) and its intervention with angiotensin-converting enzyme 
      2 (ACE2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) will be a potential 
      therapeutic target. OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to investigate 
      the efficacy of zoledronate (ZA) on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis (PF) in rats through targeting ACE2, ROCK, and VEGF signaling pathways. 
      METHODS: Fifty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: control, 
      vehicle-treated, PF, PF-ZA 50, and PF-ZA 100 groups. ZA was given in two 
      different doses 100 and 50 μg/kg/week intraperitoneally. After anesthesia, mean 
      arterial blood pressure (MBP) was measured. After scarification, lung coefficient 
      was calculated. Lung levels of ACE 2, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), transforming growth 
      factor-β (TGF-β), VEGF, glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were 
      measured. Expression of ROCK, phosphorylated myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 
      (P-MYPT1), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1), along with histopathological 
      changes and immune-histochemical staining for lung α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), 
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), and caspase-3, were evaluated. RESULTS: ZA 
      significantly prevented the decrease in MBP. ZA significantly increased ACE2, 
      GSH, and SOD and significantly decreased IL-1β, TGF-β, and VEGF in lung in 
      comparison to PF group. ZA prevented the histopathological changes induced by 
      CCl4. ZA inhibited lung expression of ROCK, P-MYPT1, MMP-1, α-SMA, TNFα, and 
      caspase-3 with significant differences favoring the high dose intervention. 
      CONCLUSION: ZA in a dose-dependent manner prevented the pathological effect of 
      CCl4 in the lung by targeting mevalonate pathway. It could be promising therapy 
      against PCPF.

AB  - Patients with cancer and severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with injectable 
      azithromycin and anakinra frequently develop dysglycemia, necessitating 
      initiation of sulfonylurea therapy (gliquidone or glimepiride). We 
      retrospectively reviewed adults (≥30 years) with diabetes and cancer who were 
      hospitalised for COVID-19 at the Central Military Hospital Bucharest and the 
      Matei Bals National Institute between March 2020 and August 2022. All patients 
      completed a 14-day course of azithromycin + anakinra and survived to discharge. 
      Glycaemic control was achieved with fixed-dose gliquidone 30 mg or glimepiride 2, 
      3, or 6 mg, chosen according to each patient's inflammatory-cardiac profile. 
      Central insulin resistance may lead to the risk of cardiometabolic syndrome 
      through the increase of inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha and PAI-1), treated with 
      gliquidone, in 50 patients with cancer infected with COVID-19, who were dependent 
      on developing immunothrombosis. Peripheral insulin resistance leads to the risk 
      of cardiovascular events through the increase of inflammatory markers, IL-6 and 
      Il-1, treated with glimepiride, in 50 patients with cancer infected with 
      COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed many lives and continues to impact 
      individuals through post-COVID-19 conditions. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head 
      (ONFH) is increasingly recognized as a major post-COVID-19 complication, yet most 
      studies are limited to case reports and small series. This study aimed to 
      evaluate COVID-19-related factors potentially contributing to ONFH development in 
      post-COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 84 
      patients with ONFH and a confirmed history of COVID-19. Baseline characteristics 
      were collected, and patients were categorized into the following groups for 
      comparative analysis: (1) vaccinated vs. unvaccinated, (2) unilateral vs. 
      bilateral ONFH, (3) dexamethasone (DEX) and methylprednisolone (MPS) vs. DEX 
      therapy, and (4) Association Research Circulation Osseus (ARCO) stage 2 vs. stage 
      3. Group differences and associations were analyzed. RESULTS: The DEX and 
      MPS-treated group had a greater extent of COVID-19 lung involvement compared to 
      the DEX-treated group (59.2% vs. 36.3%, p = 0.002), as well as longer hospital 
      stays in both general ward (14.2 days vs. 10.6 days, p = 0.018) and ICU (5.4 days 
      vs. 3 days, p = 0.017). The DEX and MPS-treated group also had a longer duration 
      of steroid therapy (19.3 days vs. 12.3 days, p < 0.001) and received higher 
      DEX-equivalent cumulative steroid doses (380 mg vs. 125 mg, p < 0.001). Notably, 
      ONFH symptoms developed earlier in the DEX and MPS-treated group compared to the 
      DEX-treated group (7.5 months vs. 12 months, p = 0.004). Multivariable logistic 
      regression analysis identified cumulative steroid dose as the sole predictor of 
      ONFH severity (OR: 1.015, 95% CI: 1.001-1.028, p = 0.032), with ARCO stage 3 
      patients receiving higher cumulative steroid doses than stage 2 patients (240 mg 
      vs. 126 mg, p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that cumulative 
      steroid dose is the primary determinant of ONFH severity in post-COVID-19 
      patients. Additionally, combined use of corticosteroids may accelerate the onset 
      of ONFH, highlighting the need for cautious steroid management in COVID-19 
      patients.

AB  - Many COVID-19 survivors experience lingering post-COVID-19 symptoms, notably 
      chronic fatigue persisting for months after the acute phase. Despite its 
      prevalence, limited research has explored effective treatments for post-COVID-19 
      fatigue. This randomized controlled clinical trial assessed the impact of 
      Amantadine on patients with post-COVID-19 fatigue. The intervention group 
      received Amantadine for two weeks, while the control group received no treatment. 
      Fatigue levels were assessed using the Visual Analog Fatigue Scale (VAFS) and 
      Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) questionnaires before and after the trial. At the 
      study's onset, VAFS mean scores were 7.90 ± 0.60 in the intervention group and 
      7.34 ± 0.58 in the control group (P-value = 0.087). After two weeks, intervention 
      group scores dropped to 3.37 ± 0.44, significantly lower than the control group's 
      5.97 ± 0.29 (P-value < 0.001). Similarly, FSS mean scores at the trial's 
      commencement were 53.10 ± 5.96 in the intervention group and 50.38 ± 4.88 in the 
      control group (P-value = 0.053). At the trial's end, intervention group scores 
      decreased to 28.40 ± 2.42, markedly lower than the control group's 42.59 ± 1.50 
      (P-value < 0.001). In this study, we report the safety, tolerability, and 
      substantial fatigue-relieving effects of Amantadine in post-COVID-19 fatigue. The 
      intervention demonstrates a statistically significant reduction in fatigue 
      levels, suggesting Amantadine's potential as an effective treatment for this 
      persistent condition.

TI  - Creatine supplementation combined with breathing exercises reduces respiratory 
      discomfort and improves creatine status in patients with long-COVID.
PG  - 101-104
LID - 10.4103/jpgm.jpgm_650_23 [doi]
AB  - Eight long-COVID patients with moderate fatigue that had lasted for ≥3 months 
      were recruited. All patients were allocated in a double-blind parallel-group 
      design to receive either 4 g of creatine per day plus breathing exercises (study 
      group) or breathing exercises only (control group) for 3 months. Creatine induced 
      a significant increase in tissue total creatine levels for all 14 locations 
      evaluated in the present study ( P < 0.05), while its levels significantly 
      dropped in the right frontal gray matter and left parietal mesial gray matter at 
      follow-up in the control group ( P < 0.05). No change in time to exhaustion was 
      demonstrated in the control group (P > 0.05), while the mean time to exhaustion 
      was significantly improved for 54 s in the study group post-administration (P = 
      0.05). These preliminary findings suggest that creatine is as an effective 
      adjuvant therapeutic to breathing exercises for tackling the clinical features in 
      long-COVID.

AB  - Pulau Kapas is tropical island which dominantly depends on land-supplied and 
      groundwater for freshwater sources. The groundwater quality was monitored 
      monthly, to identify the possible factors effecting the groundwater quality 
      throughout May to October 2022. Physico-chemical parameters were in-situ measured 
      and groundwater were collected for nutrients analysis in the laboratory. The 
      concentration of ammonium, phosphate, nitrite, and nitrate were in the range of 
      0.07-1.08 mg/L, 0.00-0.06 mg/L, BDL-18 × 10(-4) mg/L and 0.01-0.19 mg/L, 
      respectively. The cluster and principal component analysis unveiled the seawater 
      intrusion for freshwater needs was the dominant factor affecting the groundwater. 
      Followed by the dissolution of soil particles surrounds the groundwater table, 
      and the surface run-off by rainfall. In conclusion, the groundwater was affected 
      by geogenic factors as it was not extensively extracted due to movement control 
      order of Covid-19 event. This has provided significant insight for a better 
      management plan in sustaining the groundwater of Pulau Kapas.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of respiratory infectious diseases has changed in the 
      post-COVID-19 epidemic era, and mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infection in children 
      has attracted wide attention. METHODS: Children hospitalized for pneumonia in 
      Wuhan, China, in 2023 were enrolled. Respiratory secretions were obtained for the 
      targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) including mutation of MP. Pulmonary 
      inflammation was divided into bronchopneumonia and pulmonary 
      consolidation/atelectasis according to lung computed tomography imaging. RESULTS: 
      Of the 667 pediatric pneumonia, 478 were MP positive (72%). The positive rate of 
      MP detected by tNGS increased from April, and MP had become the primary pathogen 
      of pneumonia in children in 2023. The 23S rRNA mutations were all A2063G, 
      accounting for 85% of detected MP. The clinical symptoms of the mutant and 
      wild-type strains were similar, with half of them experiencing atelectasis and 
      lung consolidation. Early bronchoscopic lavage combined with azithromycin in 
      pediatric pulmonary consolidation was an effective therapy strategy, which could 
      be an alternative selection to MP pneumonia treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A2063G mutant 
      strain MP was the primary pathogen of mycoplasma pneumoniae in children recently, 
      which was often complicated by extra-pulmonary symptoms and complications.

      with Long COVID Syndrome: A Nonrandomized Controlled Pilot Study.

AB  - Several genetic markers have shown associations with muscle performance and 
      physical abilities, but the response to exercise therapy is still unknown. The 
      aim of this study was to test the response of patients with long COVID through an 
      aerobic physical therapy strategy by the Nordic walking program and how several 
      genetic polymorphisms involved in muscle performance influence physical 
      capabilities. Using a nonrandomized controlled pilot study, 29 patients who 
      previously suffered from COVID-19 (long COVID = 13, COVID-19 = 16) performed a 
      Nordic walking exercise therapy program for 12 sessions. The influence of the ACE 
      (rs4646994), ACTN3 (rs1815739), AMPD1 (rs17602729), CKM (rs8111989), and MLCK 
      (rs2849757 and rs2700352) polymorphisms, genotyped by using single nucleotide 
      primer extension (SNPE) in lactic acid concentration was established with a 
      three-way ANOVA (group × genotype × sessions). For ACE polymorphism, the main 
      effect was lactic acid (p = 0.019). In ACTN3 polymorphism, there were no main 
      effects of lactic acid, group, or genotype. However, the posthoc analysis 
      revealed that, in comparison with nonlong COVID, long COVID increased lactic acid 
      concentrations in Nordic walking sessions in CT and TT genotypes (all p < 0.05). 
      For AMPD1 polymorphism, there were main effects of lactic acid, group, or 
      genotype and lactic acid × genotype or lactic acid × group × genotype 
      interactions (all p < 0.05). The posthoc analysis revealed that, in comparison 
      with nonlong COVID, long COVID increased lactic acid concentrations in Nordic 
      walking sessions in CC and CT genotypes (all p < 0.05). Physical therapy strategy 
      through Nordic walking enhanced physical capabilities during aerobic exercise in 
      post-COVID19 patients with different genotypes in ACTN3 c.1729C>T and AMPD1 
      c.34C>T polymorphisms. These findings suggest that individuals who reported long 
      COVID who presumably exercised less beforehand appeared to be less able to 
      exercise, based on lactate levels, and the effect of aerobic physical exercise 
      enhanced physical capabilities conditioned by several genetic markers in long 
      COVID patients.

AB  - A 50-year-old man who had undergone a living-donor kidney transplant 12 years 
      prior for chronic renal failure due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney 
      disease contracted coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). He had a positive antigen 
      test, mild symptoms, sore throat, and fever of 37.9 ℃. The patient was treated 
      with molnupiravir for 5 days, and the symptoms disappeared 5 days after onset. 
      However, 10 days after onset, he developed a fever of approximately 37 ℃ and a 
      non-productive cough; 27 days after onset, the patient was hospitalized for 
      anorexia and a worsening respiratory condition. The severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen test results on admission were 
      negative, and no antiviral medications were administered against SARS-CoV-2. 
      Computed tomography revealed extensive ground-glass opacities in both lung 
      fields. The patient was treated with steroid pulse therapy, ceftriaxone, 
      atovaquone, azithromycin, and respiratory management using a high-flow nasal 
      cannula. The combined therapies were successful, and the patient was managed with 
      a nasal oxygen cannula after 3 days. Oxygen administration was discontinued after 
      6 days of hospitalization, and the patient was discharged after 14 days. Based on 
      the laboratory findings, bacterial, interstitial, and Pneumocystis pneumonia were 
      unlikely. The success of the steroid pulse therapy suggested that respiratory 
      failure was caused by pneumonia due to the immune response after COVID-19 
      infection.

TI  - Interferon gene expression declines over time post-COVID infection and in long 
      COVID patients.
PG  - 35-48

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interferons (IFNs) represent a first-line defense against viruses and 
      other pathogens. It has been shown that an impaired and uncontrolled release of 
      these glycoproteins can result in tissue damage and explain severe progression of 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, their potential role in Long-COVID 
      syndrome (LC) remains debateable. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study 
      is to shed further light on the possible role of IFNs (and related genes) gene 
      expression patterns in the progression of COVID-19 and LC patients. METHODS: We 
      carried out a multi-cohort study by analyzing the IFN gene expression patterns 
      (using different IFN gene signatures) in five cohorts of acute COVID-19 (n = 541 
      samples) and LC patients (n = 188), and compared them to patterns observed in 
      three autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematous [n = 242], systemic 
      sclerosis [n = 91], and Sjögren's syndrome [n = 282]). RESULTS: The data show 
      that, while the interferon signatures are strongly upregulated in severe COVID-19 
      patients and autoimmune diseases, it decays with the time from symptoms onset and 
      in LC patients. Differential pathway analysis of IFN-related terms indicates an 
      over activation in autoimmune diseases (IFN-I/II) and severe COVID-19 
      (IFN-I/II/III), while these pathways are mostly inactivated or downregulated in 
      LC (IFN-I/III). By analyzing six proteomic LC datasets, we did not find evidence 
      of a role of IFNs in this condition. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a potential 
      role of cytokine exhaustion mediated by IFN gene expression inactivation as a 
      possible driver of LC.

AB  - PURPOSE: The study's objective was to determine whether tocilizumab or 
      baricitinib has a higher risk of bacterial and fungal infections secondary to 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: This single-site, 
      retrospective chart review of 150 patients at a 433-bed community teaching 
      hospital aimed to investigate the rate of secondary bacterial or fungal 
      infections following COVID-19 infection in patients treated with tocilizumab or 
      baricitinib from March 2020 to June 2022. Secondary endpoints included the time 
      to hospital discharge, the rate of all-cause mortality, and the number of 
      ventilator-free days. RESULTS: Among the patients included in the study, the 
      average age was 56.7 years, 55.3% were male, and 72.0% were unvaccinated. 
      Tocilizumab (46.7%) was initiated more frequently than baricitinib (22.7%) in the 
      intensive care units. For the primary endpoint of post-COVID-19 secondary 
      infections, the baricitinib group had a lower rate (21.3%) than the tocilizumab 
      group (34.7%) (P = 0.101). With respect to the secondary endpoints, the median 
      hospital length of stay, rate of mortality, and number of ventilator days were 
      higher in the tocilizumab group. CONCLUSION: This study found no significant 
      differences in the incidence of secondary infections and time to secondary 
      infections between patients treated with baricitinib and tocilizumab.

AB  - Hypercoagulability and reduced fibrinolysis are well-established complications 
      associated with COVID-19. However, the timelines for the onset and resolution of 
      these complications remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a 
      cohort of COVID-19 patients, changes in coagulation and fibrinolytic activity 
      through ROTEM assay at different time points during the initial 30 days following 
      the onset of symptoms in both mild and severe cases. Blood samples were collected 
      at five intervals after symptoms onset: 6-10 days, 11-15 days, 16-20 days, 
      21-25 days, and 26-30 days. In addition, fibrinogen, plasminogen, PAI-1, and 
      alpha 2-antiplasmin activities were determined. Out of 85 participants, 71% had 
      mild COVID-19. Twenty uninfected individuals were evaluated as controls. ROTEM 
      parameters showed a hypercoagulable state among mild COVID-19 patients beginning 
      in the second week of symptoms onset, with a trend towards reversal after the 
      third week of symptoms. In severe COVID-19 cases, hypercoagulability was observed 
      since the first few days of symptoms, with a tendency towards reversal after the 
      fourth week of symptoms onset. A hypofibrinolytic state was identified in severe 
      COVID-19 patients from early stages and persisted even after 30 days of symptoms. 
      Elevated activity of PAI-1 and alpha 2-antiplasmin was also detected in severe 
      COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, both mild and severe cases of COVID-19 
      exhibited transient hypercoagulability, reverted by the end of the first month. 
      However, severe COVID-19 cases sustain hypofibrinolysis throughout the course of 
      the disease, which is associated with elevated activity of fibrinolysis 
      inhibitors. Persistent hypofibrinolysis could contribute to long COVID-19 
      manifestations.

TI  - Improved absorption of itraconazole tablet by co-administration with lemon 
      beverages in a lung transplant recipient: A case report.

AB  - After lung transplantation, itraconazole (ITCZ) is used as a prophylaxis for 
      aspergillosis. ITCZ is a weak base with high lipophilicity, and the dissolution 
      and absorption of ITCZ tablets and capsules are pH dependent. Therefore, ITCZ may 
      not achieve sufficient serum concentrations in patients with higher gastric pH 
      because of its poor bioavailability. We report a case of a woman in fifties with 
      post-COVID-19 respiratory failure who successfully underwent lung 
      transplantation, followed by improved bioavailability of ITCZ tablets when given 
      with acidic lemon beverages. The patient was initially administered ITCZ oral 
      solution; this was discontinued because of its unpleasant taste, nausea, and 
      vomiting. The ITCZ oral solution was replaced with ITCZ tablets 78 days after 
      transplantation; however, serum concentrations of ITCZ and hydroxy-ITCZ were 
      below the detection limit (100 ng/mL). We co-administered ITCZ tablets with 
      commercially available lemon beverages. Subsequently, serum concentrations of 
      ITCZ and hydroxy-ITCZ increased to 341 and 673 ng/mL, respectively, on the 125th 
      day after transplantation. Infection with fungi, including Aspergillus spp., was 
      not observed in this case. The patient had no adverse events such as gastric 
      ulcer or hyperglycemia. These results suggest that the co-administration of lemon 
      beverages and ITCZ tablets may help achieve better absorption of ITCZ in patients 
      taking acid suppressants.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the transmission, prevalence and genomic 
      characteristics of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii (CARB) isolated 
      from object surfaces and healthcare workers' hands in seven hospitals of Shanghai 
      in 2019 (pre-COVID pandemic) and 2023 (post-COVID pandemic). METHODS: CRAB 
      isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the broth 
      microdilution method and whole-genome sequencing. Antimicrobial resistance genes, 
      Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST), polysaccharide capsule and plasmid migration 
      were evaluated based on tools such as VFDB database, PubMLST, Kaptive, MOB-suite, 
      etc. RESULTS: Of 3,156 samples collected, 130 strains of CRAB were isolated. The 
      prevalence of CRAB in the ICU setting was significantly lower in 2023 (2.44%) 
      than in 2019 (5.60%). Objects that come into direct contact with patients served 
      as a primary source (43.85%). CRAB isolates exhibited higher resistance to 
      β-lactamase antibiotics but lower to minocycline (2.31%), tigecycline (3.08%) and 
      polymyxin B (2.31%). Five ST_Pasteur and eleven ST_Oxford were identified, 
      predominantly ST2_Pasteur (93.6%) and ST208_Oxford (40%). Two novel sequence 
      types (STs) named ST3329 and ST3331 were found in the surface of objects such as 
      door handles. Notably, two CARB isolates (designated 2023-AB023 and 2023-AB033) 
      co-harboring the bla(OXA-23), bla(OXA-91), bla(NDM-1) were found to be high 
      genomic similarity to DETAB-R21 previously isolated from an ICU patient's oral 
      swab with high environmental adaptability, reported in August 2022 in Zhejiang 
      Province of China. CONCLUSIONS: The resistance rate of CRAB was slightly lower in 
      2023 compared to 2019. However, the emergence of pan-drug-resistant CRAB, along 
      with the coexistence of carbapenemase-producing strains (OXA-23, OXA-51-like, and 
      NDM-1) in 2023, underscore the dynamic progression of antimicrobial resistance 
      (AMR) in this pathogen. These findings suggest a potential epidemiological shift 
      characterized by clonal diversification alongside persistent carbapenemase-driven 
      resistance mechanisms.

TI  - Efficacy of forskolin as a promising therapy for chronic olfactory dysfunction 
      post COVID-19.
PG  - 5793-5799

AB  - PURPOSE: Olfactory dysfunction is increasingly common among COVID-19 patients, 
      impacting their well-being. Reports have demonstrated decreased levels of cyclic 
      adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate among patients with 
      chronic olfactory dysfunction. A prospective randomized clinical trial was 
      developed to demonstrate the efficacy of an oral forskolin regimen treatment, an 
      adenylyl cyclase activator that raises intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine 
      monophosphate, for the treatment of olfactory dysfunction following COVID-19, 
      compared to placebo regimen. METHODS: The study enrolled 285 participants with 
      persistent olfactory dysfunction post COVID-19 infection, randomly assigning them 
      to receive either placebo capsules (n = 120) or oral forskolin capsules 
      (n = 165). Follow-up was conducted to track progress, with 18 participants from 
      the placebo group and 12 from the forskolin group lost during this period. 
      Olfactory function was assessed using the "Sniffin' Sticks" test, measuring 
      threshold, discrimination and identification scores before and after treatment. 
      RESULTS: Subjects administered forskolin capsules demonstrated a significant 
      enhancement in their composite TDI (threshold, discrimination and identification) 
      score, suggesting a notable amelioration in olfactory functionality. Moreover, 
      the discrimination and identification scores notably improved within the 
      forskolin group. Conversely, no significant alterations were observed in the 
      threshold scores. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that forskolin can contribute 
      potentially to improve chronic olfactory dysfunction post COVID-19. TRIAL

TI  - Greater benefits of immediate nirmatrelvir-ritonavir initiation for post-COVID 
      outcomes: a population-based retrospective cohort study.

AB  - Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is generally recommended to be initiated within five days 
      of COVID-19 symptom onset. This study examined the association between the timing 
      of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir initiation and post-acute outcomes more precisely using 
      territory-wide data in Hong Kong. We included patients aged ≥18 years who tested 
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 16, 2022, and November 9, 2023, and were 
      hospitalized with COVID-19. Treatment groups were formed based on the time from 
      the positive RT-PCR date to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir initiation. Among 15,978 
      patients who received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, 10,028 (62.8%) patients were 
      included in Day 0 group, 4973 (31.1%) in Day 1 group, and 977 (6.1%) in Day 2 or 
      later group. The control group comprised 22,312 patients who did not receive 
      nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Compared with the control group, the risks of post-acute 
      mortality were significantly lower in Day 0 group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.51, 95% CI 
      0.46-0.56; p < 0.0001) and Day 1 group (HR 0.66, CI 0.59-0.74; p < 0.0001), but 
      not in Day 2 or later group. Meta-regression results showed that more immediate 
      initiation was associated with lower risks of death and all-cause 
      hospitalization. Our findings suggested that the antiviral should be prescribed 
      immediately after COVID-19 diagnosis for achieving its greatest benefit on 
      improving post-COVID outcomes.

TI  - Association of nirmatrelvir for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection with subsequent Long 
      COVID symptoms in an observational cohort study.
PG  - e29333
LID - 10.1002/jmv.29333 [doi]
AB  - Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is approved as treatment for acute COVID-19, but the 
      effect of treatment during acute infection on risk of Long COVID is unknown. We 
      hypothesized that nirmatrelvir treatment during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      reduces risk of developing Long COVID and rebound after treatment is associated 
      with Long COVID. We conducted an observational cohort study within the Covid 
      Citizen Science (CCS) study, an online cohort study with over 100 000 
      participants. We included vaccinated, nonhospitalized, nonpregnant individuals 
      who reported their first SARS-CoV-2 positive test March-August 2022. Oral 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was ascertained during acute SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. Patient-reported Long COVID symptoms, symptom rebound and 
      test-positivity rebound were asked on subsequent surveys at least 3 months after 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 4684 individuals met the eligibility criteria, 
      of whom 988 (21.1%) were treated and 3696 (78.9%) were untreated; 353/988 (35.7%) 
      treated and 1258/3696 (34.0%) untreated responded to the Long COVID survey 
      (n = 1611). Among 1611 participants, median age was 55 years and 66% were female. 
      At 5.4 ± 1.3 months after infection, nirmatrelvir treatment was not associated 
      with subsequent Long COVID symptoms (odds ratio [OR]: 1.15; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI]: 0.80-1.64; p = 0.45). Among 666 treated who answered rebound 
      questions, rebound symptoms or test positivity were not associated with Long 
      COVID symptoms (OR: 1.34; 95% CI: 0.74-2.41; p = 0.33). Within this cohort of 
      vaccinated, nonhospitalized individuals, oral nirmatrelvir treatment during acute 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and rebound after nirmatrelvir treatment were not associated 
      with Long COVID symptoms more than 90 days after infection.

      multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Linezolid treatment has a high risk of toxicity and adverse drug 
      reactions (ADR) are frequent. Few studies have investigated risk factors of major 
      ADRs separately, therefore, we aimed to evaluate major ADRs including peripheral 
      neuropathy in relation to risk factors and drug concentration levels of linezolid 
      in a high-resource setting for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). 
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including participants treated 
      with a linezolid-containing MDR-TB regimen in Sweden 1992-2018. Data was 
      collected from medical records. ADRs were classified according to Common 
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 5.0). RESULTS: Of all 
      participants (n = 132), 43.2% were female and the median age 28 y. The median 
      linezolid treatment was 6.5 months (IQR 3.0-12.7) with a median daily dose of 9.6 
      mg/kg/d. Any ADR was seen in 58.3% (n = 77) of participants, with 35.6% having 
      peripheral neuropathy (n = 47), 27.3% anaemia (n = 36), 22.0% leukopenia (n = 36) 
      while 6.1% (n = 8) had optic neuritis. The median time for peripheral neuropathy 
      was 3.6 months (IQR 2.1-5.9) and 8.3 months (6.2-10.7) for optic neuritis. A >2.0 
      mg/L trough concentration (n = 40) was associated with anaemia (P = 0.0038) and 
      thrombocytopenia (P = 0.009) but not with peripheral neuropathy. In multivariable 
      analysis, a dose ≥12 mg/kg/d was associated with time to peripheral neuropathy 
      (HR 2.89, 95% CI 1.08-7.74, P = 0.035), anaemia (HR 6.62, 95% CI 2.22-19.8, 
      P = 0.001) and leukopenia (HR 5.23, 95% CI 1.48-18.5, P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Linezolid ADRs were frequent in a high-resource setting. Structured, regular 
      follow-up for ADRs and adjusting dosing according to body weight followed-up by 
      monitoring of drug concentrations early may reduce toxicity.

TI  - Hyperaemia during dynamic handgrip exercise is preserved in healthy young 
      subjects after recovery from COVID-19.
PG  - 841-846
LID - 10.1113/EP091656 [doi]
AB  - We sought to investigate possible impaired hyperaemia during dynamic handgrip 
      exercise (HGE) in young healthy individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. We 
      tested the vascular function in individuals recovered from COVID-19 using a 
      nitric oxide donor (i.e., sodium nitroprusside; SNP), which could revert a 
      possible impaired endothelial function during HGE. Further, we tested whether 
      individuals who recovered from COVID-19 would present exaggerated brachial 
      vascular resistance under an adrenergic agonist (i.e., phenylephrine; PHE) 
      stimuli during HGE. Participants were distributed into two groups: healthy 
      controls (Control; men: n = 6, 30 ± 3 years, 26 ± 1 kg/m(2); and women: n = 5, 
      25 ± 1 years, 25 ± 1 kg/m(2)) and subjects recovered from COVID-19 (post-COVID; 
      men: n = 6, 29 ± 3 years, 25 ± 1 kg/m(2); and women: n = 10, 32 ± 4 years, 
      22 ± 1 kg/m(2)). Participants in the post-COVID group tested positive (RT-PCR) 
      12-14 weeks before the protocol. Heart rate (HR), brachial blood pressure (BP), 
      brachial blood flow (BBF) and vascular conductance (BVC) at rest were not 
      different between groups. The HGE increased HR (Control: Δ9 ± 0.4 bpm; and 
      post-COVID: Δ11 ± 0.4 bpm) and BP (Control: Δ6 ± 1 mmHg; and post-COVID: 
      Δ12 ± 0.6 mmHg) in both groups. Likewise, BBF (Control: Δ632 ± 38 ml/min; and 
      post-COVID: Δ620 ± 27 ml/min) and BVC (Control: Δ6.6 ± 0.4 ml/min/mmHg; and 
      post-COVID: Δ6.1 ± 0.3 ml/min/mmHg) increased during HGE. SNP did not change 
      HGE-induced hyperaemia but did decrease BP, which induced a reflex-related 
      increase in HR. PHE infusion also did not change the HGE-induced hyperaemia but 
      raised BP and reduced HR. In conclusion, exercise-induced hyperaemia is preserved 
      in healthy young subjects 12-14 weeks after recovery from COVID-19 infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Photobiomodulation Therapy (PBMT) is a non-invasive treatment that 
      uses photons from the red to infrared spectrum to modulate cellular processes 
      with anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties. This study aimed to evaluate 
      the use of PBMT applied intranasally in patients with an impaired sense of smell 
      after COVID-19. METHODS: This proof-of-concept study was a randomized, 
      placebo-controlled clinical trial that recruited 81 patients with olfactory 
      disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection (1-12 months), randomly assigned to 3 
      groups: controls, red light and infrared light exposure groups. PBMT was applied 
      twice a week for five weeks, associated with prednisolone 40 mg for five days and 
      olfactory training for 90 days from the first day of laser application. UPSIT® 
      and subjective chemosensory scores were the outcomes collected before the first 
      session and three months thereafter. RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients 
      undergoing infrared PBMT showed more improvement in UPSIT® scores (+4.6 points, 
      95% CI: 1.5-7.8, p =  0.004) and a tendency towards reporting a better subjective 
      smell score at the three-month follow-up. Response rates were 26.1% (95% CI: 
      6.7-45.5), 43.5% (95% CI: 21.6-65.4), and 68% (95% CI: 48.3-87.7) in the control, 
      red and infrared groups, respectively. No major adverse events were reported. 
      CONCLUSION: Therapy with PBMT in the infrared frequency appears to be a safe 
      option in treating post-COVID olfactory disorders when combined with a five-day 
      use of systemic corticosteroid and 90 days of olfactory training.

TI  - Paracetamol Overdoses Among Danish Adolescents: A COVID-19 Perspective.
PG  - 1839-1846
LID - 10.1111/apa.70037 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study examines trends in paracetamol overdoses among Danish adolescents 
      during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective 
      observational study was conducted using data from the national databases, 
      covering all paediatric departments in Denmark from January 2016 to December 
      2023. Patients between 10 and 19 years of age diagnosed with paracetamol overdose 
      were stratified by sex, age and number of hospital admissions. As the dataset 
      covers the entire population, observed values reflect true parameters. A 
      one-sample t-test compared post-COVID-19 values to the pre-COVID-19 mean. 
      RESULTS: A total of 4.448 patients accounted for 5.794 hospital admissions due to 
      paracetamol overdoses, with a majority being girls. During the second year of the 
      pandemic (2021), a rise in overdose cases (26.5%) and hospital admissions (30.3%) 
      was observed, especially among girls. The average number of admissions per 
      patient increased, indicating repeated self-harm attempts. Cases of severe 
      overdoses leading to acute liver failure increased at Rigshospitalet. These 
      trends reversed post-pandemic. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest an association 
      between pandemic-related isolation and an increase in adolescent paracetamol 
      overdoses. While rates began to normalise after restrictions were lifted, further 
      research is needed to assess the long-term mental health impact of such 
      restrictions.

AB  - We report on sensor platform including both the advanced nanostructured Prussian 
      Blue based hydrogen peroxide sensor and the cooling-free breath aerosol (BA) 
      condenser. The latter provides an order of magnitude more concentrated BA samples 
      as compared to breath condensate collected traditionally through cooling; the 
      conclusion is based on both: specimen's conductivity, the generally accepted 
      dilution marker, and the evaluated H(2)O(2) levels (2.2-3.2 μM for healthy 
      subjects). Reliable detection of submicromolar H(2)O(2) content is possible with 
      the sensor based on nanostructured Prussian Blue (0.45-0.70 nmol cm(-2)) 
      stabilized with nickel hexacyanoferrate (1.0-1.3 nmol cm(-2)). A possibility to 
      discover the noninvasively accessed marker for post-COVID-19 syndrome illustrates 
      the horizons of the platform in clinical diagnostics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Olfactory loss is a recognized long-term dysfunction after 
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This investigation aimed to assess 
      the effect of alpha-lipoic acid as an adjuvant treatment of olfactory training on 
      the improvement of smell loss in post-COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This randomized 
      controlled trial included 128 adult outpatients who had persistent smell loss for 
      more than 3-months after COVID-19 infection. The participants were randomly 
      allocated into two groups: the intervention treatment group, which received 
      alpha-lipoic acid associated to olfactory training, and comparison treatment 
      group, which received placebo pills associated to olfactory training. The 
      participants were followed-up for 12-weeks. Olfactory dysfunction was assessed in 
      terms of Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical 
      Research Center (CCCRC) test for the Brazilian population. RESULTS: A total of 
      100 participants completed the follow-up period and were analyzed in this study. 
      Both groups have improved CCCRC score (p = 0.000), olfactory threshold 
      (p = 0.000), identification score (p = 0.000) and VAS score (p = 0.000) after 
      12-weeks follow-up. No significant differences were determined between the 
      intervention and comparison treatment groups in CCCRC score (p = 0.63), olfactory 
      threshold (p = 0.50), identification score (p = 0.96) and VAS score (p = 0.97). 
      In all these criteria, comparison treatment group went slightly worse. At the 
      endpoint of the study, the frequency of anosmia reduced to 2% in the intervention 
      treatment group and to 7.8% in the comparison treatment group. Also, 16.8% of the 
      intervention group' subjects, and 15.7% of comparison treatment group's patients 
      reached normosmia. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was a strongly significant 
      difference in olfactory function between baseline and endpoint for both groups. 
      However, based on the lack of significant difference between the intervention 
      treatment and the comparison treatment groups in terms of olfactory changes, our 
      study appoints that the alpha-lipoic acid is not better than olfactory training 
      alone to treat olfactory loss after COVID-19. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2.

TI  - Differential Profile of Hemostasis in Dengue Fever Before and After COVID-19.
LID - 10.3390/v17111431 [doi]
LID - 1431
AB  - Dengue and COVID-19 are viral diseases characterized by coagulopathies, with 
      Dengue associated with fibrinolysis and COVID-19 with prothrombotic events. 
      Furthermore, cross-reactivity between anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-DENV antibodies 
      may confer protective immunity or exacerbate disease severity. Our investigation 
      explored the impact of prior COVID-19 exposure on the immunopathogenesis of 
      Dengue, focusing on hemostatic parameters. We quantified nitrites, procoagulant, 
      anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic mediators in the plasma of Dengue patients before 
      and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We also evaluated the influence of plasma from 
      dengue patients on platelet activation in vitro using platelets from healthy 
      donors exposed to DENV-2. Hemorrhagic manifestations were more frequent in 
      pre-COVID-19 Dengue, while nitrite levels were elevated in post-COVID-19 Dengue 
      patients, particularly among those without hemorrhagic signs. Among procoagulant 
      factors, tissue factor (TF) levels were increased in post-COVID-19 Dengue, 
      whereas Factor XIII was higher in pre-COVID-19 Dengue. In contrast, antithrombin 
      (an anticoagulant) and plasminogen (a profibrinolytic factor) were more elevated 
      in pre-COVID-19 Dengue than in post-COVID-19 cases. In vitro, DENV-2-infected 
      platelets exposed to plasma of Dengue patients before and after COVID-19 showed 
      decreased nitrite production in relation to DENV-2 alone. These findings suggest 
      that prior COVID-19 exposure may influence hemostatic responses in Dengue, 
      potentially modulating disease pathophysiology and opening new avenues for 
      research and therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Favorable responses to upadacitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor, in long COVID patients 
      with predominant neuropsychiatric symptoms: case reports in 2 autistic patients 
      and one typically developing patient.

AB  - The long-term impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become evident 
      over the past 3-4 years, with the recognition of post-COVID long-term sequelae, 
      often referred to as long COVID. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are one of the 
      hallmarks of long COVID. In severe cases, it can even present features of 
      encephalopathy. Since some of the neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with long 
      COVID overlap symptoms found in neuropsychiatric disorders, it has been difficult 
      to sort out the effects of long COVID in such subjects. This is especially true 
      in patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), given their difficult 
      behavioral symptoms and other co-morbid conditions. COVID-19 is thought to affect 
      the onset or progress of encephalopathy symptoms by activation of the immune 
      system through the type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. In that case, 
      treatment would require an immunomodulating agent that targets such pathways. 
      However, such measures may not be applied to ASD subjects, in whom long COVID may 
      not even be considered as the cause of their symptoms. In this study, we present 
      the beneficial effects of upadacitinib, a JAK (janus kinase) 1 inhibitor, that 
      blocks downstream signaling of type 1 IFNs, on 3 patients, 2 with ASD and one 
      without ASD. In these patients, long COVID was thought to have triggered or 
      aggravated encephalopathy-like symptoms. The beneficial effects of upadacitinib 
      were not only noted by an improvement of their behavioral symptoms but also shown 
      by an improvement of monocyte cytokine profiles (less activated state); 
      peripheral blood monocytes were used as surrogates of microglial cells. These 
      three cases presented highlight a possible use of JAK inhibitors for treating 
      long COVID-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms in both ASD and non-ASD subjects. 
      The presented cases highlight the inherent difficulty of diagnosing long COVID in 
      ASD cases.

TI  - Anthocyanin-Rich Fraction from Kum Akha Black Rice Attenuates NLRP3 
      Inflammasome-Driven Lung Inflammation In Vitro and In Vivo.
LID - 10.3390/nu17071186 [doi]
LID - 1186
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Chronic lower respiratory tract inflammation can result 
      from exposure to bacterial particles, leading to the activation of the NLRP3 
      inflammasome pathway. These effects may cause irreversible respiratory damage, 
      contributing to persistent lung injury and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD), as observed in long COVID or bacterial pneumonia in older adults' 
      patients. Given its profound impact, the NLRP3 inflammasome has emerged as a key 
      therapeutic target for mitigating aberrant inflammatory responses. METHODS: In 
      this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of Kum Akha black rice, 
      a functional food, on the attenuation of NLRP3 inflammasome pathway using 
      lipopolysaccharide-induced A549 lung epithelial cells and a C57BL/6NJcl mouse 
      model. The anthocyanin-rich fraction from Kum Akha black rice germ and bran 
      extract (KA1-P1) was obtained using a solvent-partitioned extraction technique. 
      RESULTS: KA1-P1 exhibited a high anthocyanin content (74.63 ± 1.66 mg/g extract) 
      as determined by the pH differential method. The HPLC analysis revealed 
      cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G: 45.58 ± 0.48 mg/g extract) and 
      peonidin-3-O-glucoside (P3G: 6.92 ± 0.29 mg/g extract) as its anthocyanin's 
      active compounds. Additionally, KA1-P1 demonstrated strong antioxidant activity, 
      as assessed by DPPH and ABTS assays. KA1-P1 (12.5-100 μg/mL) possessed inhibitory 
      effects on LPS + ATP-induced A549 lung cells inflammation through the significant 
      suppressions of NLRP3, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-18 mRNA levels and the inhibition of 
      cytokine secretions in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). Mechanistic analysis 
      revealed that KA1-P1 downregulated key proteins in the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway 
      (NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1, and cleaved-caspase-1). Furthermore, in vivo studies 
      demonstrated that KA1-P1 significantly diminished LPS-induced lower respiratory 
      inflammation in C57BL/6NJcl mice, as evidenced by the reduced bronchoalveolar 
      lavage fluid and blood levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-18) 
      and diminished histopathological inflammatory lung lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 
      our findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of KA1-P1 may support 
      its application as a functional supplement or promote the consumption of 
      pigmented rice among the elderly to mitigate chronic lower respiratory tract 
      inflammation mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.

LID - e261002
AB  - A woman in her 50s contracted COVID-19 and initially presented a few weeks 
      afterwards with left eye pain and redness. She was diagnosed with uveitis and 
      treated with glucocorticoid eye drops. Renal impairment was found on laboratory 
      investigations performed following the diagnosis of uveitis, and urine testing 
      showed proteinuria. Serological testing showed no cause for the new findings, and 
      renal imaging was unremarkable. A renal biopsy was conducted and histology was 
      consistent with tubulointerstitial nephritis. A diagnosis of tubulointerstitial 
      nephritis with uveitis (TINU) was established, and she was given prednisolone, 
      with resolution of proteinuria and improvement in renal function. While TINU is 
      rare but well described in children, it can also uncommonly be a cause of renal 
      impairment in adults post COVID-19 infection, similar to cases in children.

TI  - HERV Dysregulation in a Case of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis and Multiple Sclerosis 
      Responsive to Rituximab.
LID - 10.3390/ijms26104885 [doi]
LID - 4885
AB  - This article summarizes the case of 30-year-old male diagnosed with Myalgic 
      Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and its longitudinal 
      follow-up, which provided a secondary diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) eight 
      years later. The most impactful result was his response to rituximab treatment 
      after the systematic failure of prior treatments. Although the expression of 
      endogenous retroviral proteins has been associated with autoimmunity, the patient 
      did not show increased expression of the toxic protein HERV (human endogenous 
      retrovirus)-W ENV, a target of the ongoing clinical trials with temelimab in MS 
      and long COVID-19 cases. However, genome-wide HERV transcriptome analysis by high 
      density microarrays clearly revealed a distinct profile in the patient's blood 
      supportive of an altered immune system. Limitations of the study include 
      sub-optimal frequency of magnetic resonance imaging to monitor lesion 
      progression, and similarly for reassessment of HERV profiles after rituximab. 
      Overall, the coincidence of HERV alterations and the impactful response to 
      rituximab presents the possibility of additional, more specific, therapeutic 
      targets encoded by other HERV elements yet to be discovered.

AB  - We present a female in her mid-70s with COVID-19 infection who developed 
      worsening renal function along with systemic symptoms over months. The patient 
      was initially monitored for long COVID and was referred to the nephrologist after 
      she was found to have further worsening of her renal function. She underwent a 
      renal biopsy and findings on light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron 
      microscopy were consistent with crescentic glomerulonephritis, pauci-immune type 
      with chronicity, and acute interstitial nephritis. These findings and a positive 
      anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody immunofluorescence assay (ANCA IFA) and 
      myeloperoxidase antibody confirmed myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive pauci-immune 
      glomerulonephritis. The patient was started on treatment with corticosteroids and 
      Rituximab, resulting in improvement in her symptoms and renal function.

TI  - Zilucoplan in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 
      (ZILU-COV): A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 934
LID - 10.1186/s13063-020-04884-0 [doi]
LID - 934
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Zilucoplan (complement C5 inhibitor) has profound effects on 
      inhibiting acute lung injury post COVID-19, and can promote lung repair 
      mechanisms that lead to improvement in lung oxygenation parameters. The purpose 
      of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Zilucoplan in 
      improving oxygenation and short- and long-term outcome of COVID-19 patients with 
      acute hypoxic respiratory failure. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a phase 2 academic, 
      prospective, 2:1 randomized, open-label, multi-center interventional study. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients (≥18y old) will be recruited at specialized COVID-19 
      units and ICUs at 9 Belgian hospitals. The main eligibility criteria are as 
      follows: 1) Inclusion criteria: a. Recent (≥6 days and ≤16 days) SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. b. Chest CT scan showing bilateral infiltrates within the last 2 days 
      prior to randomisation. c. Acute hypoxia (defined as PaO(2)/FiO(2) below 350 mmHg 
      or SpO2 below 93% on minimal 2 L/min supplemental oxygen). d. Signs of cytokine 
      release syndrome characterized by either high serum ferritin, or high D-dimers, 
      or high LDH or deep lymphopenia or a combination of those. 2) Exclusion criteria: 
      e. Mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours prior to randomisation. f. 
      Active bacterial or fungal infection. g. History of meningococcal disease (due to 
      the known high predisposition to invasive, often recurrent meningococcal 
      infections of individuals deficient in components of the alternative and terminal 
      complement pathways). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients in the experimental 
      arm will receive daily 32,4 mg Zilucoplan subcutaneously and a daily IV infusion 
      of 2g of the antibiotic ceftriaxone for 14 days (or until hospital discharge, 
      whichever comes first) in addition to standard of care. These patients will 
      receive additional prophylactic antibiotics until 14 days after the last 
      Zilucoplan dose: hospitalized patients will receive a daily IV infusion of 2g of 
      ceftriaxone, discharged patients will switch to daily 500 mg of oral 
      ciprofloxacin. The control group will receive standard of care and a daily IV 
      infusion of 2g of ceftriaxone for 1 week (or until hospital discharge, whichever 
      comes first), to control for the effects of antibiotics on the clinical course of 
      COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the improvement of oxygenation 
      as measured by mean and/or median change from pre-treatment (day 1) to 
      post-treatment (day 6 and 15 or at discharge, whichever comes first) in 
      PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, P(A-a)O(2) gradient and a/A PO(2) ratio. (PAO(2)= Partial 
      alveolar pressure of oxygen, PaO(2)=partial arterial pressure of oxygen, 
      FiO(2)=Fraction of inspired oxygen). RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomized 
      in a 2:1 ratio (Zilucoplan: control). Randomization will be done using an 
      Interactive Web Response System (REDCap). BLINDING (MASKING): In this open-label 
      trial neither participants, caregivers, nor those assessing the outcomes will be 
      blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 
      81 patients will be enrolled: 54 patients will be randomized to the experimental 
      arm and 27 patients to the control arm. TRIAL STATUS: ZILU-COV protocol Version 
      4.0 (June 10 2020). Participant recruitment started on June 23 2020 and is 
      ongoing. Given the uncertainty of the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the 
      anticipated end date. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered on Clinical 
      Trials.gov on May 11(th), 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04382755 ) and 
      on EudraCT (Identifier: 2020-002130-33 ). FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is 
      attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional 
      file 1). In the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the 
      familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the 
      key elements of the full protocol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term immune and metabolic effects of COVID-19 in vaccinated 
      populations remain incompletely characterized. This study aimed to analyze 
      dynamic changes in lymphocyte subpopulations (T, B, and Natural Killer [NK] cells 
      [TBNK]) and key metabolic indicators among college students post-Omicron 
      infection with prior vaccination. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort of 
      71 male students infected with the Omicron variant of COVID-19 (Beijing, China; 
      March-April 2022) and 18 uninfected controls was followed for 2 years. TBNK 
      subsets and metabolic parameters (uric acid, lipid profiles, β2-microglobulin) 
      were analyzed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-infection. RESULTS: 
      Immunologically, total lymphocytes were elevated at 3 months when compared with 
      controls (P = 0.0063). Total T cells declined at 6 and 12 months but rebounded by 
      24 months (P < 0.0001). NK cells increased until 12 months, then declined (P < 
      0.0001). B cells decreased persistently (P < 0.05). Metabolically, uric acid and 
      lipid parameters (total cholesterol, LDL-C, lipoprotein [a]) showed significant 
      fluctuations, with notable increases at 1 year post-infection (P < 0.05). 
      β2-microglobulin levels decreased significantly over time (P < 0.0001). 
      CONCLUSION: Omicron infection induces immune and metabolic disturbances lasting 
      at least 1 year, with gradual but incomplete recovery by 2 years. The interplay 
      between immune dysregulation and metabolic alterations may contribute to the 
      long-term health effects of COVID-19. Monitoring both lymphocyte and metabolic 
      dynamics may guide the long-term management of post-COVID-19 sequelae.

AB  - PURPOSE: Long COVID (LC) is a long-term debilitating disease of which the exact 
      pathophysiology is unknown. A dysregulated immune response resulting in 
      hyperresponsive immune cells is hypothesized as a key mechanism in the 
      development of LC. Several studies suggest that acute infections can leave 
      lasting epigenetic changes, which result in heightened immune reactivity. Upon 
      stimulation, these primed immune cells may exhibit exaggerated responses. This 
      form of epigenetic memory can contribute to altered immune dynamics, particularly 
      in response to induction of type I Interferons (IFN-I) pathway activation using a 
      viral mimic. Therefore, we investigated if LC patients exhibit a hyperresponsive 
      response towards viral mimics in comparison with healthy controls (HC). METHODS: 
      PBMCs of two distinct LC cohorts, characterized by a different disease course and 
      duration, were collected and transfected using Lyovec with the cGAS and RIG-I 
      agonists G3-YSD and 3p-RNA followed by measurement of IFN-I bioactivity with a 
      reporter cell line. RESULTS: Transfection of PBMCs of LC patients with the cGAS 
      and RIG-I agonists resulted in increased IFN-I bioactivity in comparison with HC. 
      Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed two distinct clusters, each 
      predominantly composed of either patients or HC. In addition, a moderate 
      correlation between RIG-I stimulation with 3p-RNA and fatigue severity scores was 
      found. CONCLUSION: These data show a hyperresponsive phenotype of immune cells of 
      LC patients upon stimulation with viral mimics. The current availability of 
      biologicals and small molecule inhibitors that interfere with aberrant IFN-I 
      pathway activation underscores the importance of pursuing future investigations 
      into this phenomenon.

TI  - Significant changes in preference of illicit drug use in a population of Hanoi, 
      Vietnam-A 6-year wastewater study (2018-2023).
PG  - 2295-2304
LID - 10.1111/add.70147 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Illicit drug use causes great harm and economical loss to 
      society, yet there is limited understanding of its prevalence in the population 
      in low-income countries like Vietnam where survey resources are scarce. In this 
      study, we used wastewater analysis as a cost-effective monitoring tool to measure 
      illicit drug use in a population of Hanoi, Vietnam, a low-income country in 
      Southeast Asia. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a longitudinal 
      observational study. Wastewater samples were collected at a sewage canal serving 
      > 430 000 people, in Hanoi, Vietnam, over a six-year period (2018-2023). 
      MEASUREMENTS: Drug biomarkers for amphetamine, methamphetamine, 
      3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), ketamine, morphine, codeine and 
      benzoylecgonine were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry via direct injection. The results were used to back-estimate per 
      capita drug consumption. Together with an evaluation of general temporal trend, 
      an interrupted time series analysis using segmented linear regression was 
      conducted to examine the potential changes in drug use associated with the 
      post-COVID-19 restriction. FINDINGS: There was a statistically significant 
      decrease in methamphetamine use, with annual averages declining from a peak value 
      of 359.2 to 125.6 mg/day/1000 people between 2018 and 2023 (P < 0.001). In 
      contrast, ketamine use increased statistically significantly, rising from 149.7 
      to 465.9 mg/day/1000 people over the study period (P < 0.001), making it the most 
      commonly used illicit drug. Cocaine and heroin use levels remained relatively 
      low, while MDMA use was relatively stable over time. In the post-COVID-19 
      restriction period, declines were observed in methamphetamine, MDMA, cocaine and 
      codeine consumption; however, only cocaine [Coefficient (standard error, 
      SE) = -1.9 (0.9), P = 0.034] and codeine [Coefficient (SE) = -42.4 (12.4), 
      P = 0.001] showed statistically significant downward trends. In contrast, 
      ketamine and heroin consumption exhibited slight but non-significant increases, 
      suggesting limited disruption during the post-restriction period. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Wastewater analysis shows that the market of illicit drugs in Vietnam is dynamic 
      and shifting toward synthetic drugs. Methamphetamine replaced heroin as the 
      substance with the highest estimated per capita use in Vietnam from 2018 to 2020 
      and was subsequently overtaken by ketamine by the end of 2022. Wastewater 
      analysis can provide information on population use of multiple substances, 
      including changes due to different factors in a cost-effective way, which is 
      essential in data-poor countries.

TI  - Morphine for chronic breathlessness (MABEL) in the UK: a health economic 
      evaluation of a multisite, parallel-group, dose titration, double-blind, 
      randomised, placebo-controlled trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare costs and health consequences and to assess the 
      cost-effectiveness of using low-dose oral long-acting morphine in people with 
      chronic breathlessness. DESIGN: Within-trial planned cost-consequences and 
      cost-effectiveness analysis of data from a multisite, parallel-group, 
      double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose, long-acting 
      morphine. SETTING: 11 hospital outpatients across the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Consenting adults with chronic breathlessness due to long-term cardiorespiratory 
      conditions. INTERVENTION: 5-10 mg two times a day oral long-acting morphine with 
      a blinded laxative for 56 days. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean and SD of 
      healthcare resource use (HRU) by trial arm; mean differences and 95% CI of costs 
      between trial arms. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean differences in 28- and 
      56-day quality-adjusted life years (QALYs based on EuroQol five-dimension 
      five-level score), Short Form-six dimensional scores and ICEpop 
      CAPability-Supportive Care Measure scores; cost-utility of long-acting morphine 
      for chronic breathlessness. RESULTS: 143 participants (75 morphine and 67 
      placebo) were randomised; 140 (90% power, males 66%, mean age 70.5 (SD 9.4)) 
      formed the modified intention-to-treat population (participants receiving at 
      least one dose of study medication). There were more inpatient and fewer 
      outpatient services used by the morphine group versus the placebo. In the 
      base-case analysis at 56 days, long-acting morphine was associated with similar 
      mean per-patient costs and QALYs. There was an increase of £24 (95% CI -£395 to 
      £552) and 0.002 (95% CI -0.004 to 0.008) QALYs. Hospitalisations were the main 
      driver of cost differences. The corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness 
      ratio was £12 000/QALY, with a probability of cost-effectiveness of 54% at a £20 
      000 willingness-to-pay threshold. In the scenario analysis that excluded costs of 
      adverse events considered unrelated to long-acting morphine by site investigators 
      and researchers, the probability of cost-effectiveness increased to 73%. 
      CONCLUSION: Oral morphine for chronic breathlessness is likely to be a 
      cost-effective intervention provided adverse events are minimised, but the effect 
      on outcome is small and cautious interpretation is warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION

AB  - Patients on B cell immunosuppressive treatments have been shown to have 
      persistent infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2). In this report, a woman treated with ibrutinib for chronic 
      lymphocytic leukemia experienced more than 40 days of coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) infection. Unexpectedly, her peripheral blood experiments showed a 
      normal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody level and a relatively elevated percentage of 
      CD19 + B cells, while an obvious decrease in the percentages of NK cells, CD4 + T 
      cells and CD8 + T cells. Further SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell analysis in this 
      patient indicated a significant decrease in the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-specific 
      IFN-γ, TNF-α or IL-2 producing CD4 + T or CD8 + T cells. Most notably, ten days 
      after the cease of ibrutinib, the PCR for SARS-CoV-2 turned negative and the 
      reduced proportions of peripheral CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells recovered. Our 
      research predicted that the depleted B-cell function therapies may play 
      considerable role in the development of long COVID-19 and the abnormal T-cell 
      subset distribution might be the underlying mechanism.

AB  - Daily exposure to diverse emerging environmental pollutants raises significant 
      concern, particularly regarding endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as triclosan 
      (TCS). Notably, in the post-COVID-19 pandemic, strategies to manage the disease 
      have increased the use of products formulated with antibacterial compounds like 
      TCS. TCS has been used worldwide as a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent over the 
      past four decades. Owing to its antibacterial and antifungal properties, it is an 
      ingredient in an array of commercial products, such as personal care, medical, 
      acrylic, veterinary, and household items. Recent data reveal its frequent 
      presence and widespread exposure in natural environments and human tissues. 
      Studies across multiple species provide compelling evidence of its 
      endocrine-disrupting effects, especially concerning reproductive hormones. 
      Several proposed mechanisms of action include interference with hormone 
      metabolism, disruption of hormone-receptor binding, and inhibition of 
      steroidogenic enzyme activity. This review aims to elucidate the sources, 
      bioaccumulation patterns, and endocrine-disrupting effects of TCS in humans. 
      Further extrapolating and discussing the impact on non-target organisms, 
      including aquatic species and rodents. Thus, it will help in guiding further 
      research and related underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Over the last decades, the release and occurrence of organic pollutants in 
      aquatic systems have become a major global concern due to their bioaccumulation, 
      toxicity, and adverse effects on the ecosystem. Tetracycline (TC), a widely used 
      antibiotic, is often found at high concentrations in the aqueous environment and 
      tends to bind with the natural colloids. Post-COVID-19 pandemic, the release of 
      surfactants in the environment has increased due to the excessive use of washing 
      and cleaning products. This study systematically investigated the interaction of 
      goethite with TC in the absence and presence of anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate, 
      SDS) and cationic (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB) surfactants. The impact 
      of various environmental parameters like pH, ionic strength, temperature, and 
      organic matter was also studied. It was observed that SDS has drastically 
      increased TC sorption onto goethite from 11 mg/g to 19 mg/g, while CTAB had the 
      opposite effect. To delineate the goethite-TC interaction mechanisms, FTIR with 
      two-dimensional correlation analysis (2D-COS) was performed. The pH of the 
      solution was crucial in the presence of SDS, while ionic strength did not affect 
      the interaction process. The sorption process was endothermic, as evidenced by 
      the increase in sorption capacity with the rise in the temperature. The presence 
      of organic matter hinders the sorption of TC onto goethite, which is also 
      observed in river water where the organic content is very high. Overall, our 
      study helps to predict the fate of organic pollutants like antibiotics in aqueous 
      environments in the coexistence of surfactants and iron oxyhydroxides.

TI  - Glasgow Early Treatment Arm Favirpiravir (GETAFIX) for adults with early stage 
      COVID-19: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 935
LID - 10.1186/s13063-020-04891-1 [doi]
LID - 935
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The GETAFIX trial will test the hypothesis that favipiravir is a more 
      effective treatment for COVID-19 infection in patients who have early stage 
      disease, compared to current standard of care. This study will also provide an 
      important opportunity to investigate the safety and tolerability of favipiravir, 
      the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of this drug and mechanisms of 
      resistance in the context of COVID-19 infection, as well as the effect of 
      favipiravir on hospitalisation duration and the post COVID-19 health and 
      psycho-social wellbeing of patients recruited to the study. TRIAL DESIGN: GETAFIX 
      is an open label, parallel group, two arm phase II/III randomised trial with 1:1 
      treatment allocation ratio. Patients will be randomised to one of two arms and 
      the primary endpoint will assess the superiority of favipiravir plus standard 
      treatment compared to standard treatment alone. PARTICIPANTS: This trial will 
      recruit adult patients with confirmed positive valid COVID-19 test, who are not 
      pregnant or breastfeeding and have no prior major co-morbidities. This is a 
      multi-centre trial, patients will be recruited from in-patients and outpatients 
      from three Glasgow hospitals: Royal Alexandra Hospital; Queen Elizabeth 
      University Hospital; and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Patients must meet all of 
      the following criteria: 1. Age 16 or over at time of consent 2. Exhibiting 
      symptoms associated with COVID-19 3. Positive for SARS-CoV-2 on valid COVID-19 
      test 4. Point 1, 2, 3, or 4 on the WHO COVID-19 ordinal severity scale at time of 
      randomisation. (Asymptomatic with positive valid COVID-19 test, Symptomatic 
      Independent, Symptomatic assistance needed, Hospitalized, with no oxygen therapy) 
      5. Have >=10% risk of death should they be admitted to hospital as defined by the 
      ISARIC4C risk index: https://isaric4c.net/risk 6. Able to provide written 
      informed consent 7. Negative pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential*) 8. 
      Able to swallow oral medication Patients will be excluded from the trial if they 
      meet any of the following criteria: 1. Renal impairment requiring, or likely to 
      require, dialysis or haemofiltration 2. Pregnant or breastfeeding 3. Of child 
      bearing potential (women), or with female partners of child bearing potential 
      (men) who do not agree to use adequate contraceptive measures for the duration of 
      the study and for 3 months after the completion of study treatment 4. History of 
      hereditary xanthinuria 5. Other patients judged unsuitable by the Principal 
      Investigator or sub-Investigator 6. Known hypersensitivity to favipiravir, its 
      metabolites or any excipients 7. Severe co-morbidities including: patients with 
      severe hepatic impairment, defined as:  • greater than Child-Pugh grade A  • AST 
      or ALT > 5 x ULN  • AST or ALT >3 x ULN and Total Bilirubin > 2xULN 8. More than 
      96 hours since first positive COVID-19 test sample was taken 9. Unable to 
      discontinue contra-indicated concomitant medications This is a multi-centre 
      trial, patients will be recruited from in-patients and outpatients from three 
      Glasgow hospitals: Royal Alexandra Hospital; Queen Elizabeth University Hospital; 
      and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomised 
      to the experimental arm of GETAFIX will receive standard treatment for COVID-19 
      at the discretion of the treating clinician plus favipiravir. These patients will 
      receive a loading dose of favipiravir on day 1 of 3600mg (1800mg 12 hours apart). 
      On days 2-10, patients in the experimental arm will receive a maintenance dose of 
      favipiravir of 800mg 12 hours apart (total of 18 doses). Patients randomised to 
      the control arm of the GETAFIX trial will receive standard treatment for COVID-19 
      at the discretion of the treating clinician. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome 
      being assessed in the GETAFIX trial is the efficacy of favipiravir in addition to 
      standard treatment in patients with COVID-19 in reducing the severity of disease 
      compared to standard treatment alone. Disease severity will be assessed using WHO 
      COVID 10 point ordinal severity scale at day 15 +/- 48 hours. All randomised 
      participants will be followed up until death or 60 days post-randomisation 
      (whichever is sooner). RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomised 1:1 to the 
      experimental versus control arm using computer generated random sequence 
      allocation. A minimisation algorithm incorporating a random component will be 
      used to allocate patients. The factors used in the minimisation will be: site, 
      age (16-50/51-70/71+), history of hypertension or currently obsess (BMI>30 or 
      obesity clinically evident; yes/no), 7 days duration of symptoms 
      (yes/no/unknown), sex (male/female), WHO COVID-19 ordinal severity score at 
      baseline (1/2or 3/4). BLINDING (MASKING): No blinding will be used in the GETAFIX 
      trial. Both participants and those assessing outcomes will be aware of treatment 
      allocation. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): In total, 302 patients will 
      be randomised to the GETAFIX trial: 151 to the control arm and 151 to the 
      experimental arm. There will be an optional consent form for patients who may 
      want to contribute to more frequent PK and PD sampling. The maximum number of

AB  - BACKGROUND: The global emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2019 posed 
      unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems, disrupting routine services and 
      necessitating swift adaptations. Harm reduction programs, vital for addressing 
      substance use-related health risks, faced unique challenges during the pandemic, 
      impacting vulnerable populations. This study focuses on the repercussions of 
      Covid-19 on harm reduction policies in Iran, specifically examining the 
      distribution of condoms, syringes, and methadone to high-risk individuals 
      attending Triangle Centers. AIM: The study aims to assess the impact of the 
      Covid-19 pandemic on harm reduction services in Iran and provide evidence-based 
      insights for policy adjustments. Using Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA), 
      the research analyzes trends in the distribution of condoms, syringes, and 
      methadone before and after the official declaration of the pandemic in February 
      2020. METHOD: ITSA, a valuable tool for evaluating program impacts, was employed 
      to analyze data collected from Triangle Centers in Lorestan Province, Iran. 
      Monthly records of harm reduction services (condoms, syringes, methadone) from 
      January 2017 to February 2023 were extracted. The pre-intervention period spanned 
      January 2017 to January 2020, with the post-intervention period extending from 
      February 2020 to February 2023. Statistical analyses were conducted using the 
      Newey-West technique, Combi-Huizinga autocorrelation test, and Ordinary Least 
      Squares (OLS) regression, with a significance threshold set at P-value < 0.05. 
      RESULTS: Following the onset of Covid-19, the level change in condom distribution 
      to high-risk individuals showed a significant decline, decreasing by 2,168.87 
      units per month (95% CI: -2,405.57 to -1,932.15). Methadone dispensation, crucial 
      for opioid harm reduction, also witnessed a substantial level change, decreasing 
      by 5,007.60 cc per month (95% CI: -6,251.75 to -3,763.45). Additionally, the 
      provision of syringes decreased significantly, with a level change of -601.01 
      units per month (95% CI: -706.39 to -495.62). CONCLUSION: This study reveals 
      significant disruptions in harm reduction services in Iran post-Covid-19, 
      emphasizing the need for targeted interventions. Factors such as fear, stigma, 
      resource reallocation, and logistical challenges contribute to the observed 
      decreases. Policymakers must prioritize sustaining harm reduction services during 
      pandemics, ensuring continuity for vulnerable populations. The findings 
      underscore the importance of proactive policy development and preparedness to 
      prevent delays and inequalities in accessing essential services for individuals 
      with high-risk behaviors. Overall, integrating harm reduction into pandemic 
      planning is crucial for a resilient and equitable health system.

TI  - A practice quit model to test early efficacy of medications for alcohol use 
      disorder in a randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 543-553

AB  - RATIONALE: Screening novel medications for alcohol use disorder (AUD) requires 
      models that are both efficient and ecologically-valid. Ideally, such models would 
      be associated with the outcomes of a given medication in clinical trials. 
      OBJECTIVES: To test a novel human laboratory model in which individuals with 
      intrinsic motivation to change their drinking engage in a "practice quit" attempt 
      consisting of 6 days of complete abstinence from alcohol. METHOD: Individuals 
      with current AUD completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
      of naltrexone (50 mg), varenicline (2 mg bid), or matched placebo. Participants 
      were titrated onto the study medication for 1 week prior to starting the 6-day 
      practice quit attempt. During the practice quit attempt, participants completed 
      daily interviews with research staff. All participants completed an alcohol 
      cue-exposure paradigm before starting the study medication and after 2 weeks of 
      study medication. RESULTS: There were no significant medication effect on drinks 
      per drinking day (F(2,49) = 0.66, p = 0.52) or percent days abstinent (F(2,49) = 
      0.14, p = 0.87) during the 6-day practice quit period. There were no medication 
      effects on alcohol cue-reactivity (F(2,44) = 0.80, p = 0.46). Notably, 
      participants sharply reduced their drinking during the entire 13-day medication 
      treatment period, as compared to reducing only during the 6-day practice quit 
      period. During the total medication period, higher levels of motivation to change 
      was associated with higher percent days abstinent (F(1,49) = 8.12, p < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study reports mostly null findings, which challenges us to 
      decompose its nuanced design to consider model refinements. Possible changes to 
      the model include considering the requirement for intrinsic motivation for 
      change, including a longer practice quit period, encompassing the medication 
      administration timeframe in the practice quit period, increasing the required 
      sample size for signal detection, and examining a post COVID-19 pandemic cohort.

TI  - Real-world cost-effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir as treatment for 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Belgian setting with omicron variant.
PG  - 1432821
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2024.1432821 [doi]
LID - 1432821
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is an oral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      in patients who are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease. This 
      antiviral has proven to significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization and 
      death compared to no anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment in this target population. This 
      paper aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in Belgium 
      using real-world evidence. METHODS: A static decision tree model was developed to 
      capture the health progression of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
      Outcomes were expressed in Quality Adjusted-Life Years (QALYs), hospitalizations, 
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, deaths and Long Covid cases, derived from 
      epidemiological data over the first full year of the Omicron variant's 
      circulation (2022). Costs were calculated for the year 2023 from the healthcare 
      payer's perspective. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the 
      robustness of the cost-effectiveness results. RESULTS: In a cohort of 1,000 
      patients, treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is projected to save 95 QALYs and 
      €82,658 compared to no anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment over a lifetime horizon. These 
      savings primarily stem from the reduction in hospitalizations among vulnerable 
      patients who typically require a longer recovery time. The analysis also 
      indicates 5 fewer ICU admissions and 8 fewer premature deaths per 1,000 infected 
      patients. CONCLUSION: In the context of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      administering nirmatrelvir-ritonavir to patients at high risk of severe disease 
      improves health outcomes and reduces costs. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is 100% likely 
      to be cost-effective at a willingness to pay of €2,000 per QALY.

TI  - No reduced serum serotonin levels in patients with post-acute sequelae of 
      COVID-19.
PG  - 463-466
LID - 10.1007/s15010-024-02397-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Approximately 10-20% of patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 
      experience post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), presenting with fatigue and 
      neurocognitive dysfunction along various other symptoms. Recent studies suggested 
      a possible role of a virally induced decrease in peripheral serotonin 
      concentration in the pathogenesis of PASC. We set out to verify this finding in 
      an independent and well-defined cohort of PASC patients from our post-COVID-19 
      outpatient clinic. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-control study 
      including 34 confirmed PASC patients and 14 healthy controls. Clinical assessment 
      encompassed physician examination as well as questionnaire based evaluation. 
      Eligibility required ongoing symptoms for at least 6 months post-PCR-confirmed 
      infection, relevant fatigue (CFS ≥ 4), and no other medical conditions. Serum 
      serotonin was determined by LC-MS/MS technique. RESULTS: Serum serotonin levels 
      in PASC patients did not significantly differ from healthy controls. Most 
      subjects had normal serotonin levels, with no subnormal readings. Subgroup 
      analyses showed no significant differences in serotonin levels based according to 
      predominant fatigue type, high overall fatigue score or depression severity. 
      CONCLUSION: We postulate that peripheral serotonin is no reliable biomarker for 
      PASC and that it should not be used in routine diagnostic. Therapy of PASC with 
      serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or tryptophane supplementation should not be based 
      solely on the assumption of lowered serotonin levels.

AB  - Bronchopleural fistula (BPF), a sinus tract between the bronchial system and the 
      pleural space, is associated with COVID-19 and can lead to pneumothorax, which 
      increases the mortality rate. Due to the analytical status of COVID-19 patients, 
      sealing the BPF necessitates the least minimal invasive treatment. Herein, we 
      demonstrated a technique of sealing post-COVID-19 BPF with direct injection of 
      cyanoacrylate glue under the guidance of a computed tomography scan. Following 
      glue injection, the BPF was completely sealed in all four patients. In 
      conclusion, in COVID-19 patients with small and distal BPF, percutaneous glue 
      injection is recommended for BPF closure.

AB  - Sarocladium strictum (S. strictum) meningitis is a rare but rapidly progressive 
      and often fatal central nervous system (CNS) infection, typically presenting with 
      nonspecific symptoms such as headache, fever, and limb weakness, making early 
      diagnosis difficult. We report a 42-year-old woman with a history of sarcoidosis 
      and prior immunosuppressive therapy who developed fever and headache during 
      travel in Inner Mongolia, China. Initially misdiagnosed as an upper respiratory 
      tract infection, her condition worsened within one week. Cerebrospinal fluid 
      analysis showed elevated intracranial pressure, protein, and cell counts. 
      Next-generation sequencing and lymph node biopsy confirmed S. strictum 
      meningitis. With the increasing use of immunosuppressants in the post-COVID-19 
      era, the incidence of rare fungal CNS infections may rise. Amphotericin B 
      combined with voriconazole appears to be an effective treatment. In cases with 
      cerebral vasculitis, adjunctive anti-vasculitis therapy may be helpful. However, 
      the exact mechanisms remain unclear.

AB  - Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) has been described as a severe neurological 
      complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Following the adjustment of 
      COVID-19 prevention strategies on December 7, 2022, the virus spread rapidly and 
      extensively across China. This study aimed to explore the changing 
      characteristics of AE pre- and post- COVID-19 epidemic in Guangxi, China. A total 
      of 169 patients who were first diagnosed with AE and admitted to the First 
      Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from November 1, 2021 to 
      December 31, 2023 were enrolled in this case-control study. Patients with the 
      onset of AE before or after December 7, 2022, were respectively classified into 
      the pre- and post- COVID-19 epidemic groups. There were 78 AE patients in the 
      pre-COVID-19 epidemic group and 91 patients in the post-COVID-19 epidemic group. 
      Compared to the AE patients pre-COVID-19 epidemic group, AE patients in the 
      post-COVID-19 group had higher rates of abnormal movements (p = 0.013), autonomic 
      dysfunction (p = 0.003), higher CASE scores (p = 0.041), and higher probabilities 
      of complications such as pneumonia (p = 0.025) and other autoimmune diseases 
      (p = 0.014). A higher proportion of AE patients in the post-COVID-19 pandemic 
      period received rituximab treatment compared to those in the pre-COVID-19 (16.48% 
      vs. 6.41%, p = 0.043). Among the AE patients infected with COVID-19, those who 
      has a relapse of AE also had a higher risk of complications with tumors, 
      autoimmune diseases, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities, and 
      higher baseline modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (median [IQR]:4[4,5] vs. 
      3[2.75,4.25], p = 0.029). AE patients in the post-COVID-19 epidemic group suffer 
      from more severe clinical symptoms and higher rates of other immune diseases. 
      Rituximab is commonly used in the post-COVID-19 epidemic period. Relapsed AE 
      patients with COVID-19 had a higher risk of complications with tumors, autoimmune 
      diseases, abnormal MRIs, and higher baseline mRS.

TI  - Effect of Olfactory Training in COVID-19 Related Olfactory Dysfunction-A 
      Placebo-Controlled Trial.
PG  - 4849-4857
LID - 10.1002/lary.32275 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Olfactory training is a recommended treatment in patients with 
      olfactory dysfunction after COVID-19. However, the effectiveness of olfactory 
      training in COVID-19-induced olfactory dysfunction has been studied; only a few 
      studies have included a placebo group to compare the effect of traditional 
      olfactory training with odor-free olfactory training. In this randomized 
      placebo-controlled trial, we evaluate the effect of olfactory training with 
      essential oils versus olfactory training with placebo oils in patients with 
      post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with COVID-19 
      induced olfactory dysfunction were randomized to the intervention or control 
      group. Patients in the intervention group performed classic olfactory training 
      with four essential oils (orange, lavender, clove, and peppermint) twice daily 
      for 12 weeks, while the control group performed the same olfactory training but 
      with odor-free placebo oils. Olfactory function was assessed using the Sniffin 
      Sticks extended TDI test at baseline and at follow-up after the 12-week 
      intervention. RESULTS: The intervention group did not significantly improve their 
      olfactory function compared to the control group after olfactory training. 
      Additionally, no associations were found between changes in olfactory function 
      after olfactory training and age, gender, rhinitis, time since infection, or 
      pre-infection vaccine. A regression analysis showed that the presence of parosmia 
      was associated with reduced effectiveness of olfactory training. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study found that 12 weeks of classical olfactory training is not effective 
      in the treatment of COVID-19 induced olfactory dysfunction. Moreover, the study 
      indicates that parosmia reduces the effect of olfactory training significantly.

TI  - Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia, Opportunistic Candida krusei Infection, and Acute 
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Treated with 
      Bosentan: A Case Report.
PG  - e946400

AB  - BACKGROUND Despite global vaccination efforts, COVID-19 still necessitates 
      effective treatments for severe cases that can quickly escalate to 
      life-threatening complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome 
      (ARDS) and secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Here, we present the 
      clinical journey of a 73-year-old Ecuadorian man who developed severe COVID-19 
      pneumonia complicated by an opportunistic Candida krusei infection and ARDS, 
      subsequently progressing to long-term PAH, managed with bosentan, an endothelin 1 
      (ET-1) antagonist. CASE REPORT The patient, vaccinated with 2 doses of CoronaVac, 
      experienced severe COVID-19 complications, including ARDS and secondary PAH, 
      further complicated by a C. krusei infection. Despite prompt mechanical 
      ventilation and intensive care, his condition rapidly deteriorated. Clinical 
      evaluation confirmed COVID-19-associated ARDS, secondary PAH, and C. krusei 
      infection through bronchoalveolar lavage. The therapeutic approach combined 
      bosentan (125 mg twice daily) with dual antifungal therapy, leading to 
      significant stabilization and eventual discharge. Post-discharge assessments 
      showed persistent cardiopulmonary dysfunction, consistent with post-COVID-19 
      syndrome. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights critical COVID-19 complications in a 
      vaccinated patient. While vaccination may provide substantial protection, 
      COVID-19 pneumonia treated with corticosteroids can increase the risk of 
      opportunistic infections like C. krusei, and ARDS can lead to pulmonary fibrosis 
      and PAH. This case underscores the need for research on therapeutic strategies 
      for complex COVID-19 cases and emphasizes comprehensive, personalized care for 
      managing COVID-19 complications and sequelae.

TI  - Baricitinib and Infliximab Mitigate the Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition 
      (EndMT) Induced by Cytokines in HUVECs.
LID - 10.3390/ijms26178672 [doi]
LID - 8672
AB  - Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is associated with various 
      pathologies including cardiovascular, inflammatory, and fibrotic diseases or 
      neoplasia. Concerning COVID-19, multiple organ dysfunctions and long COVID 
      syndrome are mediated by microvascular damage and, recently, the role of 
      SARS-CoV-2 peptide fragments in the induction of EndMT was demonstrated. Here, we 
      investigated the immune-mediated effects of Spike S1 of SARS-CoV-2 on EndMT and 
      demonstrated that cytokines secreted by S1-activated macrophages, mainly TNFα + 
      IFNγ, also induce the phenotypical switch in HUVECs. In particular, a loss of the 
      typical cobblestone morphology is observed, along with a huge reduction in 
      endothelial adhesion molecules, such as vWF, CD31, and VE-cadherin, and a 
      concomitant acquisition of mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin and FSP1 
      protein. In addition, the combined use of the drug infliximab, targeting TNFα, 
      and baricitinib, an inhibitor of the JAK-STAT pathway, hinders the phenotypical 
      changes by restoring the proper expression of endothelial markers. The protective 
      effect of these drugs is evident not only when they are added to the culture 
      medium together with the trigger, but also when added later, i.e., once EndMT has 
      been started. These findings reinforce the role of COVID-19-associated cytokine 
      storm in endothelial dysfunction and in the onset of the fibrotic process and 
      sustain the clinical relevance of infliximab and baricitinib for the prevention 
      of vascular damage.

LID - S0960-8524(24)01571-2 [pii]

AB  - As the harm of benzalkyl dimethylammonium compounds (BACs) on human health and 
      environment was discovered, alkyltrimethyl ammonium compound (ATMAC) and 
      dialkyldimethyl ammonium compound (DADMAC), which belong to quaternary ammonium 
      compounds (QACs), were likely to replace BACs as the main disinfectants. This 
      study simulated the iterative use of QACs to explore their impact on resistance 
      genes (RGs) in nitrification systems pre-contaminated by BACs. ATMAC could 
      initiate and maintain partial nitrification. DADMAC generated higher levels of 
      reactive oxygen species and lactate dehydrogenase, leading to increased 
      biological toxicity in bacteria. The abundance of intracellular RGs of sludge was 
      higher with the stress of QACs. DADMAC also induced higher extracellular 
      polymeric substance secretion. Moreover, it facilitated the transfer of RGs from 
      sludge to water, with ATMAC disseminating RGs through si-tnpA-04 and DADMAC 
      through si-intI1. Sediminibacterium might be potential hosts for RGs. This study 
      offered insights into disinfectant usage in the post-COVID-19 era.

TI  - Gut microbiome as biomarker for triclosan toxicity in Labeo rohita: 
      bioconcentration, immunotoxicity and metagenomic profiling.
PG  - 102-111

AB  - Triclosan (TCS) is a lipophilic, broad spectrum antimicrobial agent commonly used 
      in personal care products with a projected continuous escalation in aquatic 
      environments in the post COVID 19 era. There is rich documentation in the 
      literature on the alteration of physiological responses in fish due to TCS 
      exposure; however, studies on gut associated bacteria of fish are still scarce. 
      This is the first attempt to determine changes in bacterial community structure 
      due to exposure of TCS on Labeo rohita, a commercially essential freshwater 
      species, using 16S V3-V4 region ribosomal RNA (rRNA) next-generation sequencing 
      (NGS). Chronic exposure of TCS at environmentally realistic concentrations viz. 
      1/5th (T(1): 0.129 mg/L) and 1/10th (T(2): 0.065 mg/L) of LC(50) for 28 days 
      resulted in the dose dependent bioconcentration of TCS in the fish gut. Prolonged 
      exposure to TCS leads to disruption of gut bacteria evidenced by down regulation 
      of the host immune system. Additionally, high-throughput sequencing analysis 
      showed alternation in the abundance and diversity of microbial communities in the 
      gut, signifying Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia as dominant phyla. Significant 
      changes were also observed in the relative abundance of Chloroflexi and 
      Gammatimonadetes phyla in TCS exposed groups. The study revealed that gut 
      microbiome can be used as a biomarker in assessing the degree of TCS toxicity in 
      commercially important fish species.

AB  - Post-infectious symptoms of COVID-19-such as persistent dyspnea, psychological 
      disturbances, and reduced quality of life-continue to pose significant health 
      challenges for convalescent patients. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been 
      widely used as a complementary therapeutic approach to alleviate post-COVID 
      sequelae. This retrospective study evaluated the clinical effects of 2 TCM 
      prescriptions, Fuzheng Yifei Formula (FZYF) and Fuzheng Anshen Formula (FZAS), on 
      the psychological state, dyspnea, and quality of life among patients recovering 
      from COVID-19. Medical records of 114 COVID-19 convalescent patients treated at 
      the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine were 
      retrospectively reviewed. Based on the treatment regimen, patients were 
      categorized into 2 groups: FZYF (n = 77) and FZAS (n = 37). Clinical data were 
      collected at baseline, 7 days, 14 days, and during follow-up. Changes in 
      psychological status, dyspnea severity, and quality-of-life scores were analyzed 
      using validated assessment tools, including the General Health Questionnaire 
      (GHQ-12), the Modified Borg Scale, and the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) 
      Health Survey. Both FZYF and FZAS were associated with significant improvements 
      in psychological well-being, with mean GHQ-12 scores decreasing from 14.5 at 
      baseline to 9 at follow-up (P < .05). Dyspnea symptoms improved across both 
      groups, with an average reduction of 3.5 points on the Modified Borg Scale. The 
      SF-36 results indicated notable enhancements in both physical and mental health 
      domains, showing mean improvements of 22% and 23%, respectively. No statistically 
      significant difference was found between the 2 formulas, although FZYF showed 
      slightly superior benefits in respiratory symptom relief. The retrospective 
      analysis suggests that the FZYF may help alleviate long-term respiratory and 
      psychological symptoms among COVID-19 convalescents, thereby potentially 
      improving their overall quality of life. The FZAS, while showing comparable 
      trends of benefit, appeared to exert relatively greater influence on mental and 
      emotional well-being. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution 
      given the non-randomized design and limited sample size, and further validation 
      through large-scale controlled studies is warranted.

AB  - Aromatic immunity in traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) is the medical knowledge 
      accumulated in the process of people's struggling with diseases. It plays an 
      important role in plague prevention, disease treatment, health preservation, and 
      rehabilitation, and has profound TCM basic theoretical support and abundant 
      modern scientific evidence. With the in-depth promotion of the Healthy China 
      initiative and the succession of health needs in the post-COVID-19 era, how to 
      practice the health concept of aromatic immunity in TCM and develop its health 
      service resources with high quality has become an important proposition to be 
      discussed urgently. This paper summarizes the cognitive process, puts forward the 
      basic concept, discusses the scientific connotation and clinical application 
      value, and looks forward to the future development trend of aromatic immunity in 
      TCM, aiming to provide guidance for the development of great health products and 
      promote the application of aromatic immunity in TCM in serving people's health.

PG  - 145-149
AB  - The state of long-COVID and post-COVID syndrome is associated with the presence 
      of low-grade inflammation (LGI) in patients, associated, among other things, with 
      impaired permeability of natural barriers for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of 
      gram-negative flora. Objective - to study the effect of adding polyphenolic grape 
      concentrate to the course of spa treatment in patients with bronchial asthma and 
      post-covid syndrome on the state of LGI, intestinal permeability and edotoxemia. 
      The study included 70 patients with a verified diagnosis of Bronchial asthma who 
      had suffered from infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Patients were divided into two 
      groups. The intervention group (n=40) received grape polyphenol concentrate in 
      addition to standard spa treatment. Subsequent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
      (ELISA) performed for determination of the levels of C-RP, zonulin, LPS, 
      lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and 
      bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI). In patients of the 1st group 
      a reliable decrease in the level of C-RP (p<0,039) and the concentration of 
      circulating LPS (p=0,008) was revealed. In both groups, a statistically 
      significant increase in the concentration of BPI and zonulin was registered 
      (p<0,05). The use of polyphenolic grape concentrate in elderly patients in the 
      post-covid period reduces the level of C-RP and circulating blood endotoxin, 
      which in the future should reduce the likelihood of long-term consequences 
      associated with NCI, including cardiovascular, in patients who have undergone 
      NCI.

AB  - Triclosan (TCS), a widely used antimicrobial, has emerged as a concerning aquatic 
      pollutant, especially post-COVID-19 due to increased disinfectant use. The study 
      aimed to investigate the toxic impacts of TCS on Labeo rohita, revealing a 96-h 
      LC(50) of 0.742 mg/L. Well-acclimatized fish were categorised into three groups: 
      one control and two treatment (T1 and T2) that were exposed to 1/10th and 1/5th 
      of 96-h LC(50) i.e., 0.0742 mg/L and 0.148 mg/L, respectively for 6 weeks under 
      semi-static condition. Significantly (p < 0.05) elevated extents of reactive 
      oxygen species (ROS) in the liver indicated enhanced oxidative stress. The 
      activities of enzymatic antioxidants viz. superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase 
      (CAT) were significantly (p < 0.05) increased while the reduced glutathione (GSH) 
      levels were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in a dose- and duration-dependent 
      manner. A significant (p < 0.05) increase was observed in the lipid peroxidation 
      (LPO) rate, which coincided with disruptions in the histological structure of the 
      liver. Significant (p < 0.05) induction in Micronuclei frequency validated 
      genomic instability. Furthermore, Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress was marked by 
      the increased intracellular calcium levels and elevated expression of grp78, 
      chop, atf4, perk, eIF2α and gadd34 in TCS-exposed groups. Moreover, the 
      consequent activation of bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, apaf-1 and the regulation of 
      bcl-2 due to ER-stress, ultimately resulted in apoptosis of hepatocytes. Pearson 
      correlation matrix and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) further underscored key 
      interactions among parameters. Our findings demonstrate that the TCS, at its 
      sub-lethal concentrations, is causing severe anomalies and even cell-death via 
      triggering ER-stress-mediated apoptotic pathway in the fish liver.

AB  - This study describes a case of a 30-year-old female who developed Lichen Planus 
      Pigmentosus Inversus (LPPI) two weeks after receiving the second dose of the 
      Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The patient presented with deep brown macules 
      and patches in the axillae, submammary folds, and groins. Histopathological 
      examination confirmed the diagnosis of LPPI. The patient followed up for two 
      months, during which the patient received topical tacrolimus 0.1 % and 
      corticosteroids, and pigmentation declined within three weeks. No new lesions 
      were observed at the 2-month follow up. This is the fifth worldwide reported case 
      of LPPI post-COVID-19 vaccination, associated with mRNA vaccines. This case 
      highlights the importance of recognizing the potential of LPPI as a rare variant 
      of lichen planus that occurs following Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination. 
      Healthcare providers, especially dermatologists, should maintain awareness of 
      this potential adverse effect to ensure prompt recognition and appropriate 
      management.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Colchicine on Pulmonary Fibrosis Using Imaging in 
      Patients With Moderate-to-Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia.
PG  - 9923052
LID - 10.1155/carj/9923052 [doi]
LID - 9923052
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary fibrosis may develop in patients with severe clinical 
      conditions, especially those with high inflammatory indicators. We aimed to 
      investigate the 15-month follow-up clinical outcomes in patients with 
      moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with colchicine and to evaluate its 
      potential in preventing post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis. METHOD: This study, 
      beginning with a retrospective analysis of 1489 selected patients, and a 
      follow-up assessment of 155 patients conducted 15 months after hospital 
      discharge. This study included 90 patients presenting with COVID-19 pneumonia 
      with severity ranging from moderate to severe who were treated with colchicine 
      alongside standard care, and 65 patients who did not receive colchicine were 
      included in the control group to serve as a comparator. Patients who received 
      colchicine treatment were included in Group 1, and those that did not in Group 2. 
      RESULTS: From admission to the 15-month follow-up, patients receiving colchicine 
      exhibited a significant regression in chest CT abnormalities when compared with 
      the control group (p < 0.05). Additionally, 65.6% (n = 59) of the colchicine 
      group experienced symptomatic improvement, significantly higher than 35.4% 
      (n = 23) in the control group (p < 0.05). Ninety patients who received colchicine 
      treatment had Stage 3, 4, or 5, and only 28 had Stage 3, 4, or 5 pulmonary 
      fıbrosis at the end of 15 months. After 15 months of follow-up, all 20 patients 
      initially classified as Stage 5 who received colchicine remained at Stage 5 
      pulmonary fibrosis, whereas in the control group, 2 patients (3.1%) were 
      fibrosis-free, and the others presented with Stage 1 (n = 23; 35.4%), Stage 3 
      (n = 23; 35.4%), Stage 4 (n = 9; 13.8%), or Stage 5 (n = 8; 12.3%) pulmonary 
      fibrosis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that colchicine therapy might 
      reduce pulmonary fibrosis progression in individuals affected by COVID-19 
      pneumonia. Clinicians should consider colchicine treatment to prevent pulmonary 
      fibrosis.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has significantly influenced the dietary habits of humans, 
      emphasizing the incorporation of natural ingredients to enhance immunity towards 
      viral and bacterial infections. Curcumin (Cur), a widely used traditional 
      medicine in various Asian countries and a natural coloring agent, has gained 
      popularity, leading to surge in its usage specially in post COVID-19 era. This 
      surge has led to increased scrutiny of the potential side effects of excessive 
      Cur use, with recent reports suggesting it may result in inactivation of DNA and 
      reduce adenosine triphosphate levels, leading to health risks. In this work, we 
      synthesized highly fluorescent nitrogen-doped carbon dots with a 
      photoluminescence quantum yield of 72.9 % for the sensitive and selective 
      detection of Cur. The developed fluorescent probe exhibits excellent sensory 
      response towards Cur within a concentration range of 0.081-51.45 µM, achieving an 
      ultra-low detection limit of 15.91 nM. The sensor was successfully tested on real 
      food samples like ginger powder, turmeric powder, and curry powder, demonstrating 
      good recovery rates. To assess the practicality of the sensor system, we 
      developed a 3D-printed smartphone-integrated device platform for curcumin 
      detection through fluorescence image analysis. This developed platform exhibited 
      promising results, achieving a limit of detection (LoD) of 132.28 nM across a 
      curcumin concentration range of 0.13-54.00 µM. This device platform holds 
      significant potential for the development of efficient sensors for real-time 
      detection of Cur in food samples.

TI  - Methadone Program Directors' Perceptions of Barriers and Supports to Engage 
      People with Opioid Use Disorders in Methadone Services.
PG  - 322-326

AB  - Background: Methadone programs to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) are highly 
      regulated, but many of their restrictions were relaxed during COVID-19, such as 
      expanded medication take-home privileges and telehealth access. Many of these 
      reforms have been sustained post-COVID-19, but substantial risks for overdose 
      persist nationally. Identifying non-pandemic factors that improve service access 
      and utilization is crucial to prevent additional mortality. Objectives: The goal 
      of this study was to identify key stakeholder recommendations for improving 
      methadone services and reducing treatment barriers. Results: In this study, 9 of 
      the 10 program directors of methadone service programs in Philadelphia were 
      surveyed in April-June 2023. The expansion of take-home privileges was perceived 
      as beneficial for treatment access; however, additional changes to service 
      delivery were deemed necessary to further improve outcomes. Specifically, program 
      directors consistently identified staffing challenges (e.g., recruitment, 
      retention, quality) as critical barriers to patient access and retention within 
      their programs, suggesting an urgent need to invest in the substance use 
      workforce. Program directors noted the importance of addressing other social 
      determinants of health to improve service use, such as assistance with basic 
      needs (e.g., housing, transportation, and benefits) and social factors (e.g., 
      stigma). Directors perceived reduced patient demand as adversely affecting 
      service use. Some attributed this to changes in the drug supply (e.g., fentanyl, 
      xylazine) as well as a shift in patient preferences towards other forms of 
      medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Conclusions: Program directors of 
      methadone outpatient treatment programs identified important policies, workforce 
      factors, and resources required to improve substance use services to address the 
      rapidly evolving drug crisis.

AB  - The control and management of environmental pollutants in surface water are 
      closely linked with the Yangtze River's safety. However, quantities of chemical 
      industry enterprises along the river potentially caused the release of unknown 
      semi-volatile organic pollutants (SVOPs). The real pollution status and risk 
      levels caused by SVOPs have not been understood. Here, we first revealed the 
      concentration, distribution and ecological risks of SVOPs in surface water of the 
      Yangtze River Basin from integrated nontargeted analysis (NTA) to targeted 
      analysis. A total of 485 SVOPs were identified by NTA in 213 surface samples 
      across the basin for three seasons. The use of disinfectants significantly 
      reduced unsaturated bonds of SVOPs compared to pre- and post-COVID-19 periods. 
      The chemical raw materials and intermediates dominated 91.7 % concentration 
      composition of 151 SVOPs. The other raw materials, plasticizers and pesticides 
      were the primary contributors to ecological risks across the entire basin. We 
      also first quantified that at least 71.7 % of SVOP types, 29.5 % of concentration 
      levels, and 27.2 % of ecological risks were underestimated. Numerous unnoticed 
      SVOPs, such as triallyl isocyanurate, 2-(methylthio)phenyl isothiocyanate, should 
      be considered as introducing the partition supervision. These findings will 
      support the control and management of unknown SVOPs in the Yangtze River Basin.

AB  - In the post-COVID-19 period, triclosan (TCS), a biocidal compound widely used in 
      pharmaceuticals and personal care products, has gained attention as an emerging 
      contaminant in aquatic environments. Although its presence is well-documented in 
      freshwater systems, limited information is available on its occurrence and 
      ecotoxicological risks in marine environments. The present study investigated TCS 
      concentrations in seawater, sediments and fish samples collected along the 
      southwest coast of India. Elevated levels were recorded at sites influenced by 
      riverine discharges (estuaries), with mean concentrations of 3.39 ng L(-1) in 
      water, 0.86 ng g(-1) in sediments, and 106.9 ng g(-1) in fish tissues. Temporal 
      analysis indicated that TCS levels in the sediment matrix exhibited minimal 
      seasonal variation, with the highest concentration recorded in pre-monsoon 
      period. Rivers served as major pathways for TCS transport to the marine 
      environment, contributing an estimated annual flux of 26.2 kg through water and 
      0.75 metric tons through sediments, with the Tamirabarani River alone accounting 
      for approximately 8.14 kg yr(-1). After its release, TCS persistence in the 
      marine system was positively influenced by total organic carbon (TOC), biological 
      oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) and negatively by pH, 
      salinity and electrical conductivity (EC). Ecotoxicological risk assessment 
      indicated significant risks to primary producers (Risk Quotient, RQ > 1), with

      Bioaccumulation patterns in fish were more pronounced in estuarine regions and 
      varied among species according to their niche and feeding habits.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been over a year since the first documented case of the 
      COVID-19 virus was recorded. Since then, our understanding of this virus has 
      continually evolved, however, its wide-ranging effects are still unfolding. 
      Similar to previously studied viral infections, severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been shown to lead to a degree 
      of autoimmunity in patients who are recovering from its effects. Due to its 
      effects on the innate immune system, such as the toll-like receptors and 
      complement system, a varying degree of proinflammatory markers can become 
      widespread in those who continue to recover from the virus. This case series 
      offers a unique perspective on how COVID-19 has had dramatic effects on those 
      already suffering from inflammatory rheumatic conditions, such as rheumatoid 
      arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or fibromyalgia. As the ever-lasting 
      effects of COVID-19 are still unfolding, this case series is one of few to 
      discuss the development and changes of patients with rheumatic conditions. This 
      study hopes to encourage larger studies to be conducted on the effects of COVID- 
      19 on autoimmune conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: Seven patients were identified 
      with new manifestations of rheumatic conditions, which included 3 cases of 
      rheumatoid arthritis, 2 cases of polymyalgia rheumatica, 1 case of reactive 
      arthritis, and 1 case of cutaneous lupus. Post-COVID syndrome was also diagnosed 
      in 7 other patients. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis presented with symptoms 
      4-5 weeks after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Symptoms of polyarticular joint 
      pain, swelling, and morning stiffness were reported in this group. These patients 
      were treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and experienced an 
      improvement in symptoms on follow-up. Two cases of polymyalgia rheumatica were 
      identified in patients that were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 six weeks 
      prior. One patient had no significant past medical history and the other patient 
      had a history of rheumatoid arthritis, which was well controlled. These patients 
      experienced weakness and tenderness in the proximal joints with elevated levels 
      of ESR and CRP. They were treated with prednisone and showed improvement. 
      Reactive arthritis was diagnosed in 1 patient who presented with swelling in both 
      hands and wrists 2 days after being diagnosed with COVID-19. This patient began 
      to experience symptoms of reactive arthritis 2 days after resolution of initial 
      COVID-19 symptoms and this persisted for 3 months. The patient was managed with 
      methylprednisolone injections and NSAIDs, which improved her symptoms. Post-COVID 
      syndrome was identified in 7 patients. All patients were female and had a history 
      of well-controlled fibromyalgia. Patients generally experienced fatigue, 
      headaches, and memory fog, which had variable onset from a few days and up to 4 
      weeks after being diagnosed with COVID-19. One patient had a complete recovery of 
      her symptoms at follow-up 3 months after the initial presentation. The other 6 
      patients continued to report symptoms of post-COVID syndrome at follow-up. 
      Patients were managed with lifestyle modifications and their previous 
      fibromyalgia treatment. CONCLUSION: While cases of COVID-19 continue to rise, 
      complications of this disease are still being discovered. Those who initially 
      recover from COVID-19 may experience new-onset rheumatic conditions, worsening of 
      previously diagnosed rheumatic conditions, or post-COVID syndrome. As we continue 
      to learn more about the effects of COVID-19, the awareness of these 
      manifestations will play a key role in the appropriate management of these 
      patients.

OAB - In some patients, respiratory symptoms and imaging abnormalities persist after 
      acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia [1–3]. Chest computed 
      tomography (CT) scans generally show diffuse parenchymal lung abnormalities 
      consistent with organising pneumonia [4]. It has been proposed that the novel 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could act as a 
      trigger to exalt the presence of pre-existing interstitial lung abnormalities 
      encountered in the general population, especially in smokers. Previous 
      observational studies reported improvement with glucocorticoids in symptomatic 
      patients with post-COVID-19 diffuse parenchymal lung abnormalities (PC-DPLAS) 
      [4–6]. A recent guideline recommended glucocorticoids for treating PC-DPLAS [3]. 
      However, there are no randomised controlled trials on therapies for this 
      condition.

TI  - Evaluation of Cerebrovascular Reactivity and Vessel Wall Imaging in Patients With 
      Prior COVID-19: A Prospective Case-Control MRI Study.
PG  - 257-264
LID - 10.2214/AJR.22.28267 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with acute stroke, possibly caused 
      by viral tropism to the vascular endothelium. Whether cerebrovascular endothelial 
      dysfunction and inflammation persist after acute infection is poorly understood. 
      OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this study were to assess the association between 
      prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and vessel wall 
      imaging (VWI) abnormalities and to explore the association between CVR impairment 
      and post-COVID neurologic conditions. METHODS. This prospective study included 15 
      participants with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (11 women, four men; mean age, 43 
      years; mean time since infection, 238 days; three with prior critical illness, 12 
      with prior mild illness; seven with post-COVID neurologic conditions) and 10 
      control participants who had never had SARS-CoV-2 infection (two women, two men; 
      mean age, 44 years) from July 1, 2021, to February 9, 2022. Participants 
      underwent research MRI that included arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging 
      with acetazolamide stimulus to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) and calculate 
      CVR. Examinations also included VWI, performed with a contrast-enhanced 
      black-blood 3D T1-weighted sequence. An age- and sex-adjusted linear model was 
      used to assess associations between CVR and prior infection. A t test was used to 
      assess associations between CVR and post-COVID neurologic conditions in 
      participants with previous infection. A difference of proportions test was used 
      to assess associations between VWI abnormalities and infection status. RESULTS. 
      Mean whole-cortex CBF after acetazolamide administration was greater in 
      participants without previous infection than in participants with previous 
      infection (73.8 ± 13.2 [SD] vs 60.5 ± 15.8 mL/100 gm/min; p = .04). Whole-brain 
      CVR was lower in participants with previous infection than those without previous 
      infection (difference, -8.9 mL/100 g/min; p < .001); significantly lower CVR was 
      also observed in participants with previous infection after exclusion of those 
      with prior critical illness. Among participants with previous infection, CVR was 
      lower in those with than those without post-COVID neurologic conditions, although 
      this difference was not significant (16.9 vs 21.0 mL/100 g/min; p = .22). Six of 
      15 (40%) participants with previous infection versus 1 of 10 (10%) participants 
      without previous infection had at least one VWI abnormality (p = .18). All VWI 
      abnormalities were consistent with atherosclerosis. CONCLUSION. SARS-CoV-2 
      infection is associated with chronic impairment of CVR. The mechanism is unknown 
      from this study. CLINICAL IMPACT. Future studies are needed to determine the 
      clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2-associated CVR impairment.

AB  - A 42-year-old male patient presented with profound impairment of vision in both 
      eyes, just as he was recovering from COVID-19. A known diabetic and hypertensive, 
      he suffered from COVID-19 pneumonia further complicated by ARDS, septicaemia and 
      acute kidney injury. His vision on presentation was finger counting close to face 
      bilaterally with multiple, yellowish lesions at the posterior pole. Based on the 
      clinical findings and previous blood culture report, it was diagnosed as candida 
      retinitis and treated with oral and intravitreal anti-fungals. The lesions were 
      regressing at follow-up. This is a post COVID-19 presumed candida retinitis case 
      report.

TI  - Maxillary Bone Necrosis in Post-COVID-19 Patients: Possibility of 
      Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of Jaws (MRONJ) Induced by Tocilizumab.
PG  - e454-e457
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0000000000010184 [doi]
AB  - Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) is a serious condition often 
      linked with antiresorptive, immune modulating, and antiangiogenic drugs, 
      initially associated with bisphosphonates but now including a broader range of 
      medications. Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor-inhibiting monoclonal 
      antibody used for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and recently for COVID-19 
      to reduce IL-6 activity and alleviate symptoms, has raised concerns over its 
      potential to induce MRONJ, particularly in post-COVID-19 patients. A case 
      involving a 36-year-old male who developed tooth mobility and pain in the right 
      maxillary posterior region after COVID-19 treatment with tocilizumab and 
      dexamethasone is highlighted. Despite treatments like antibiotics, the necrosis 
      persisted until more extensive surgery was performed, leading to improvement 
      without recurrence over 2 years. This case emphasizes the need for awareness and 
      research into the risk of MRONJ in patients treated with tocilizumab after 
      COVID-19, underlining the importance for healthcare professionals to recognize 
      and manage this complication.

TI  - Selenium Deficiency Due to Diet, Pregnancy, Severe Illness, or COVID-19-A 
      Preventable Trigger for Autoimmune Disease.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22168532 [doi]
LID - 8532
AB  - The trace element selenium (Se) is an essential part of the human diet; moreover, 
      increased health risks have been observed with Se deficiency. A sufficiently high 
      Se status is a prerequisite for adequate immune response, and preventable endemic 
      diseases are known from areas with Se deficiency. Biomarkers of Se status decline 
      strongly in pregnancy, severe illness, or COVID-19, reaching critically low 
      concentrations. Notably, these conditions are associated with an increased risk 
      for autoimmune disease (AID). Positive effects on the immune system are observed 
      with Se supplementation in pregnancy, autoimmune thyroid disease, and recovery 
      from severe illness. However, some studies reported null results; the database is 
      small, and randomized trials are sparse. The current need for research on the 
      link between AID and Se deficiency is particularly obvious for rheumatoid 
      arthritis and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Despite these gaps in knowledge, it seems 
      timely to realize that severe Se deficiency may trigger AID in susceptible 
      subjects. Improved dietary choices or supplemental Se are efficient ways to avoid 
      severe Se deficiency, thereby decreasing AID risk and improving disease course. A 
      personalized approach is needed in clinics and during therapy, while 
      population-wide measures should be considered for areas with habitual low Se 
      intake. Finland has been adding Se to its food chain for more than 35 years-a 
      wise and commendable decision, according to today's knowledge. It is unfortunate 
      that the health risks of Se deficiency are often neglected, while possible side 
      effects of Se supplementation are exaggerated, leading to disregard for this safe 
      and promising preventive and adjuvant treatment options. This is especially true 
      in the follow-up situations of pregnancy, severe illness, or COVID-19, where 
      massive Se deficiencies have developed and are associated with AID risk, 
      long-lasting health impairments, and slow recovery.

AB  - Compromised male reproductive health, including reduced testosterone and sperm 
      count, is one of the long COVID symptoms in individuals recovering from 
      mild-severe disease. COVID-19 patients display testicular injury in the acute 
      stage and altered serum fertility markers in the recovery phase, however, 
      long-term implications on the testis remain unknown. This study characterized the 
      consequences of SARS-CoV-2 on testis function. The K18-hACE2 mice that survived 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection were followed for one month after infection and the 
      testicular injury and function markers were assessed at different stages of 
      infection and recovery. The long-term impact of infection on key testes 
      function-related hormones and male fertility was measured. The efficacy of 
      inflammation-suppressing drug in preventing testicular injury was also evaluated. 
      The morphological defects like sloughing of spermatids into the lumen and 
      increased apoptotic cells sustained for 2-4 weeks after infection and correlated 
      with testicular inflammation and immune cell infiltration. Transcriptomic 
      analysis revealed dysregulation of inflammatory, cell death, and steroidogenic 
      pathways. Furthermore, reduced testosterone levels associated with a transient 
      reduction in sperm count and male fertility. Most testicular impairments resolved 
      within one month of infection. Importantly, dexamethasone treatment attenuated 
      testicular damage, inflammation, and immune infiltration. Our results implicate 
      virus-induced cytokine storm as the major driver of testicular injury and 
      functional impairments, timely prevention of which limits testis damage. These 
      findings serve as a model for evaluating therapeutics in long COVID patients and 
      may guide clinical strategies to improve male reproductive health outcomes 
      post-SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - With the increase in respiratory conditions including lung cancer post covid-19 
      pandemic, drug-loaded nanoparticulate dry powder inhalers (DPIs) can facilitate 
      targeted lung delivery as a patient-friendly, non-invasive method. The aim of 
      this work was to synthesise and optimise iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) 
      containing dactinomycin as a model drug, using Quality by Design principles. 
      Chitosan and sodium alginate were investigated as polymeric coatings. The mass 
      median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), fine particle fraction (FPF), burst-effect 
      (BE), entrapment-efficiency and the emitted-dose (ED) were investigated in 
      initial screening studies and outcomes used to set up a Design of Experiments. 
      Results revealed that chitosan IONPs were superior to that of sodium alginate in 
      delivering DPI with optimal properties [ED (89.9%), FPF (59.7%), MMAD (1.59 µm) 
      and BE (12.7%)]. Design space for targeted IONPs included formulations containing 
      2.1-2.5% dactinomycin and 0.5-0.9% chitosan. Differential scanning calorimetry 
      and X-ray diffraction and SEM-EDS analysis revealed effective formation of IONPs, 
      and TEM images revealed the production of spherical IONPs with particle size of 
      4.4 ± 0.77 nm. This work overcame the light sensitivity of dactinomycin to 
      potentially target the high molecular weight drugs to the lungs, with controlled 
      delivery based on a reduced burst effect.

TI  - Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor signalling pathway: A promising 
      therapeutic option for COVID-19.
PG  - e2500
LID - 10.1002/rmv.2500 [doi]
AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuously 
      producing new variants, necessitating effective therapeutics. Patients are not 
      only confronted by the immediate symptoms of infection but also by the long-term 
      health issues linked to long COVID-19. Activation of epidermal growth factor 
      receptor (EGFR) signalling during SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes virus 
      propagation, mucus hyperproduction, and pulmonary fibrosis, and suppresses the 
      host's antiviral response. Over the long term, EGFR activation in COVID-19, 
      particularly in COVID-19-induced pulmonary fibrosis, may be linked to the 
      development of lung cancer. In this review, we have summarised the significance 
      of EGFR signalling in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discussed the 
      targeting of EGFR signalling as a promising strategy for COVID-19 treatment and 
      highlighted erlotinib as a superior option among EGFR inhibitors. Erlotinib 
      effectively blocks EGFR and AAK1, thereby preventing SARS-CoV-2 replication, 
      reducing mucus hyperproduction, TNF-α expression, and enhancing the host's 
      antiviral response. Nevertheless, to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of 
      erlotinib, relevant clinical trials involving an appropriate patient population 
      should be designed.

AB  - The host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infection can result in prolonged pathologies collectively referred to as 
      post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC) or long COVID. To better understand the 
      mechanism underlying long COVID biology, we compared the short- and long-term 
      systemic responses in the golden hamster after either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A 
      virus (IAV) infection. Results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 exceeded IAV in its 
      capacity to cause permanent injury to the lung and kidney and uniquely affected 
      the olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory epithelium (OE). Despite a lack of 
      detectable infectious virus, the OB and OE demonstrated myeloid and T cell 
      activation, proinflammatory cytokine production, and an interferon response that 
      correlated with behavioral changes extending a month after viral clearance. These 
      sustained transcriptional changes could also be corroborated from tissue isolated 
      from individuals who recovered from COVID-19. These data highlight a molecular 
      mechanism for persistent COVID-19 symptomology and provide a small animal model 
      to explore future therapeutics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe COVID-19 is uncommon, restricted to 19% of the total 
      population. In response to the first virus wave (alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2), we 
      investigated whether a biomarker indicated severity of disease and, in 
      particular, if variable expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in 
      blood might clarify this difference in risk and of post COVID -19 conditions 
      (PCC). METHODS: The IRB-approved study compared patients hospitalized with severe 
      COVID-19 to healthy controls. Severe infection was defined requiring oxygen or 
      increased oxygen need from baseline at admission with positive COVID-19 PCR. A 
      single blood sample was obtained from patients within a day of admission. ACE2 
      RNA expression in blood cells was measured by an RT-PCR assay. Plasma ACE1 and 
      ACE2 enzyme activities were quantified by fluorescent peptides. Plasma TIMP-1, 
      PIIINP and MMP-9 antigens were quantified by ELISA. Data were entered into REDCap 
      and analyzed using STATA v 14 and GraphPad Prism v 10. RESULTS: Forty-eight 
      patients and 72 healthy controls were recruited during the pandemic. ACE2 RNA 
      expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was rarely detected 
      acutely during severe COVID-19 but common in controls (OR for undetected ACE2: 
      12.4 [95% CI: 2.62-76.1]). ACE2 RNA expression in PBMC did not determine plasma 
      ACE1 and ACE2 activity, suggesting alternative cell-signaling pathways. Markers 
      of fibrosis (TIMP-1 and PIIINP) and vasculopathy (MMP-9) were additionally 
      elevated. ACE2 RNA expression during severe COVID-19 often responded within hours 
      to convalescent plasma. Analogous to oncogenesis, we speculate that potent, 
      persistent, cryptic processes following COVID-19 (the renin-angiotensin system 
      (RAS), fibrosis and vasculopathy) initiate or promote post-COVID-19 conditions 
      (PCC) in susceptible individuals. CONCLUSIONS: This work elucidates biological 
      and temporal plausibility for ACE2, TIMP1, PIIINP and MMP-9 in the pathogenesis 
      of PCC. Intersection of these independent systems is uncommon and may in part 
      explain the rarity of PCC.

AB  - Vascular dysfunction has been reported in adults who have recovered from 
      COVID-19. To date, no studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of 
      persistent COVID-19-associated vascular dysfunction. Our purpose was to quantify 
      nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation in healthy adults who have recovered from 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hypothesized that COVID-19-recovered adults would have 
      impaired NO-mediated vasodilation compared with adults who have not had COVID-19. 
      In methods, we performed a cross-sectional study including 10 (5 men/5 women, 
      24 ± 4 yr) healthy control (HC) adults who were unvaccinated for COVID-19, 11 (4 
      men/7 women, 25 ± 6 yr) healthy vaccinated (HV) adults, and 12 (5 men/7 women, 
      22 ± 3 yr) post-COVID-19 (PC, 19 ± 14 wk) adults. COVID-19 symptoms severity 
      (survey) was assessed. A standardized 39°C local heating protocol was used to 
      assess NO-dependent vasodilation via perfusion (intradermal microdialysis) of 15 
      mM N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester during the plateau of the heating response. 
      Red blood cell flux was measured (laser-Doppler flowmetry) and cutaneous vascular 
      conductance (CVC = flux/mmHg) was expressed as a percentage of maximum (28 mM 
      sodium nitroprusside + 43°C). In results, the local heating plateau (HC: 
      61 ± 20%, HV: 60 ± 19%, PC: 67 ± 19%, P = 0.80) and NO-dependent vasodilation 
      (HC: 77 ± 9%, HV: 71 ± 7%, PC: 70 ± 10%, P = 0.36) were not different among 
      groups. Neither symptom severity (25 ± 12 AU) nor time since diagnosis correlated 
      with the NO-dependent vasodilation (r = 0.46, P = 0.13; r = 0.41, P = 0.19, 
      respectively). In conclusion, healthy adults who have had mild-to-moderate 
      COVID-19 do not have altered NO-mediated cutaneous microvascular function.NEW & 
      NOTEWORTHY Healthy young adults who have had mild-to-moderate COVID-19 do not 
      display alterations in nitric oxide-mediated cutaneous microvascular function. In 
      addition, healthy young adults who have COVID-19 antibodies from the COVID-19 
      vaccinations do not display alterations in nitric oxide-mediated cutaneous 
      microvascular function.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus initiates infection via interactions between the viral spike 
      protein and the ACE2 receptors on host cells. Variants of concern have mutations 
      in the spike protein that enhance ACE2 binding affinity, leading to increased 
      virulence and transmission. Viral RNAs released after entry into host cells 
      trigger interferon-I (IFN-I) mediated inflammatory responses for viral clearance 
      and resolution of infection. However, overreactive host IFN-I responses and 
      pro-inflammatory signals drive COVID-19 pathophysiology and disease severity 
      during acute infection. These immune abnormalities also lead to the development 
      of post-COVID syndrome if persistent. Novel therapeutics are urgently required to 
      reduce short- and long-term pathologic consequences associated with SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. Apabetalone, an inhibitor of epigenetic regulators of the BET protein 
      family, is a candidate for COVID-19 treatment via a dual mechanism of action. In 
      vitro, apabetalone downregulates ACE2 gene expression to limit SARS-CoV-2 entry 
      and propagation. In pre-clinical models and patients treated for cardiovascular 
      disease, apabetalone inhibits expression of inflammatory mediators involved in 
      the pathologic cytokine storm (CS) stimulated by various cytokines. Here we show 
      apabetalone treatment of human lung epithelial cells reduces binding of viral 
      spike protein regardless of mutations found in the highly contagious Delta 
      variant and heavily mutated Omicron. Additionally, we demonstrate that 
      apabetalone counters expression of pro-inflammatory factors with roles in CS and 
      IFN-I signaling in lung cells stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our results support 
      clinical evaluation of apabetalone to treat COVID-19 and post-COVID syndrome 
      regardless of the SARS-CoV-2 variant.

AB  - The host immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      includes the induction of a group of natural antiviral cytokines called 
      interferons (IFNs). Although originally recognized for their ability to potently 
      counteract infections, the mechanistic functions of IFNs in patients with varying 
      severities of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have highlighted a more complex 
      scenario. Cellular and molecular analyses have revealed that timing, location, 
      and subtypes of IFNs produced during severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 infection play a major role in determining disease progression and 
      severity. In this review, we summarize what the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us 
      about the protective and detrimental roles of IFNs during the inflammatory 
      response elicited against a new respiratory virus across different ages and its 
      longitudinal consequences in driving the development of long COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance, a growing public health 
      problem in Pakistan, have been hampered by the lack of high-quality national and 
      provincial-level antimicrobial consumption data. The singular objective of this 
      retrospective study was to measure antimicrobial consumption over 3 years between 
      2019 and 2021. METHODS: The study was designed to estimate antimicrobial 
      consumption at National and Regional levels. Antimicrobial consumption data was 
      collected by IQVIA covering 110 districts of Pakistan in which 88% of sales are 
      census (accurate sales collected directly from distributors), whereas 12% of 
      sales (sales of 300 pharmacies) are projected on the national level. To determine 
      the usage for 3 consecutive years, the consumption of antibiotics was calculated 
      as defined daily doses (DDD) of antibiotics per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID). 
      RESULTS: The results of our study demonstrated a steep increase in the 
      consumption of antimicrobials from 2019 to 2021. An increase in consumption of 
      most classes of antibiotics was observed both nationally and Regionally. 
      Quinolones, penicillins (co-amoxiclav), macrolides, and third-generation 
      cephalosporins remained the most frequently used antibiotics nationally. A 40% 
      increase in intravenous use of antimicrobials was observed between 2019 and 2021 
      at the national level. Moxifloxacin, Levofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin, and linezolid 
      were the most commonly used intravenous antibiotics. Region 7 (Peshawar) 
      demonstrated the highest consumption, followed by Region 1 (Karachi) and Region 6 
      (Faisalabad). Among the most commonly used antibiotics, the use of 
      third-generation cephalosporin (cefixime), quinolones, penicillins (amoxicillin + 
      clavulanic acid), and macrolides (azithromycin) was most noticeable in all 
      regions, particularly in those with the higher consumption of antibiotics. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although the increase in consumption of all antibiotics is 
      concerning, the steep increase in the use of watch and reserve category 
      antibiotics during the study period calls for immediate actions to limit and 
      regulate their usage.

TI  - Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Secretome for Post-COVID-19 Pulmonary Fibrosis: A New 
      Therapy to Treat the Long-Term Lung Sequelae?
LID - 10.3390/cells10051203 [doi]
LID - 1203
AB  - To date, more than 100 million people worldwide have recovered from COVID-19. 
      Unfortunately, although the virus is eradicated in such patients, fibrotic 
      irreversible interstitial lung disease (pulmonary fibrosis, PF) is clinically 
      evident. Given the vast numbers of individuals affected, it is urgent to design a 
      strategy to prevent a second wave of late mortality associated with COVID-19 PF 
      as a long-term consequence of such a devastating pandemic. Available antifibrotic 
      therapies, namely nintedanib and pirfenidone, might have a role in attenuating 
      profibrotic pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection but are not economically sustainable 
      by national health systems and have critical adverse effects. It is our opinion 
      that the mesenchymal stem cell secretome could offer a new therapeutic approach 
      in treating COVID-19 fibrotic lungs through its anti-inflammatory and 
      antifibrotic factors.

      juvenile idiopathic arthritis on treatment with TNF inhibitors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mass vaccination is the most effective strategy for controlling the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate the 6-month immunogenicity after 
      BNT162b2-COVID-19 vaccination in adolescents with JIA on TNFi treatment. METHODS: 
      This single-centre study included adolescents with JIA treated with TNFi for at 
      least 18 months. Patients received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine 
      (Pfizer-BioNTech) from 15 April to 15 May 2021. Quantitative measurement of IgG 
      antibodies to SARS-CoV-2-spike-protein-1 was performed at 1, 3 and 6 months 
      post-vaccination. RESULTS: Overall, 21 adolescents with JIA in clinical remission 
      at the time of vaccinations were enrolled. None of them discontinued TNFi/MTX 
      treatment at the time of vaccine administration or during the follow-up period. 
      All patients developed a sustained humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 at 1 and 
      3 months after vaccination (P < 0.05). The antibody levels decreased 
      significantly at 6 months post-vaccination (P < 0.01). The type of JIA did not 
      reveal any differences in the humoral response at 3 (P = 0.894) or 6 months 
      post-vaccination (P = 0.72). No difference was detected upon comparison of the 
      immunogenicity between the different treatment arms (adalimumab vs etanercept) at 
      3 (P = 0.387) and 6 months (P = 0.526), or TNFi monotherapy vs combined therapy 
      (TNFi plus methotrexate) at 3 (P = 0.623) and 6 months (P = 0.885). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Although mRNA vaccines develop satisfactory immunogenicity at 1 month and 3 
      months post-vaccination in adolescents with JIA on TNFi, SARS-CoV-2 antibody 
      titres decrease significantly overtime, remaining at lower levels at 6 months. 
      Further collaborative studies are required to determine long-term immunogenicity, 
      real duration of immune protection and the need for a booster vaccine dose.

TI  - Assessing the Potential of an Enzymatically Liberated Salmon Oil to Support 
      Immune Health Recovery from Acute SARS-CoV-2 Infection via Change in the 
      Expression of Cytokine, Chemokine and Interferon-Related Genes.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25136917 [doi]
LID - 6917
AB  - Cytokines, chemokines, and interferons are released in response to viral 
      infection with the ultimate aim of viral clearance. However, in SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, there is an imbalanced immune response, with raised cytokine levels 
      but only a limited interferon response with inefficient viral clearance. 
      Furthermore, the inflammatory response can be exaggerated, which risks both acute 
      and chronic sequelae. Several observational studies have suggested a reduced risk 
      of progression to severe COVID-19 in subjects with a higher omega-3 index. 
      However, randomized studies of omega-3 supplementation have failed to replicate 
      this benefit. Omega-3 fats provide important anti-inflammatory effects; however, 
      fatty fish contains many other fatty acids that provide health benefits distinct 
      from omega-3. Therefore, the immune health benefit of whole salmon oil (SO) was 
      assessed in adults with mild to moderate COVID-19. Eleven subjects were 
      randomized to best supportive care (BSC) with or without a full spectrum, 
      enzymatically liberated SO, dosed at 4g daily, for twenty-eight days. Nasal swabs 
      were taken to measure the change in gene expression of markers of immune response 
      and showed that the SO provided both broad inflammation-resolving effects and 
      improved interferon response. The results also suggest improved lung barrier 
      function and enhanced immune memory, although the clinical relevance needs to be 
      assessed in longer-duration studies. In conclusion, the salmon oil was well 
      tolerated and provided broad inflammation-resolving effects, indicating a 
      potential to enhance immune health.

      report from Northeast India.
PG  - 1833-1836
LID - 10.4103/ijo.IJO_61_22 [doi]
AB  - Multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder may be seen in the 
      acute setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection or even 
      post-recovery. Such patients may present with optic neuropathy along with 
      weakness in the back and lower limbs. Ascending paralysis can present with 
      respiratory distress in acute COVID-19 infection and may even prove to be fatal. 
      We report a unique case of a 16-year-old female with past history of COVID-19 
      infection having optic neuropathy, and radioimaging showing demyelinating plaques 
      in the central nervous system with spinal cord edema. Serology showed positivity

TI  - Autoimmune nodopathy with anti-NF186 antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection: a 
      case report.
PG  - 405

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autoimmune nodopathy is a distinct entity characterized by antibodies 
      targeting nodal/paranodal proteins like neurofascin-186 (NF186), leading to 
      conduction defects and neurological dysfunction. This report highlights a unique 
      case of autoimmune nodopathy with anti-NF186 antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old female developed acute limb numbness 
      and weakness ten days post-COVID-19 diagnosis, which progressed to respiratory 
      muscle paralysis necessitating mechanical ventilation. Initial treatments with 
      intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids were ineffective. Diagnosis of autoimmune 
      nodopathy with anti-NF186 antibodies was confirmed through clinical examination, 
      electromyography (EMG), and serum antibody testing using cell-based assays. The 
      patient showed partial improvement with plasma exchange therapy and achieved 
      stability after rituximab treatment, consistent with the typical treatment 
      response pattern for anti-NF186 autoimmune nodopathy. Notably, re-infection with 
      SARS-CoV-2 did not exacerbate her symptoms, and a gradual recovery of muscle 
      strength was observed over time, with the patient regaining substantial 
      independence in daily activities by November 2023. CONCLUSIONS: This case 
      represents the first reported occurrence of anti-NF186 autoimmune nodopathy 
      following SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the potential link between viral 
      triggers and autoimmune neurological disorders. It emphasizes the importance of 
      testing for specific nodal/paranodal antibodies in post-COVID neurological 
      presentations and highlights the superior efficacy of plasma exchange and B-cell 
      depleting therapies over conventional treatments in managing nodopathies.

TI  - Overview of anti-viral effects of probiotics via immune cells in pre-, mid- and 
      post-SARS-CoV2 era.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak has caused significant global changes and increased public 
      awareness of SARS-CoV-2. Substantial progress in developing vaccines, enhancing 
      sanitation practices, and implementing various measures to combat the virus, 
      including the utilization of probiotics has been made. This comprehensive review 
      examined the medical impact of clinically proven probiotics on infectious 
      diseases, considering three crucial time periods: before (pre-), during (mid-), 
      and after (post-) COVID-19 pandemic era. This review also showed a perspective on 
      the use of probiotics to stimulate the innate immune system and prevent 
      infectious diseases. In pre-COVID-19 era, several probiotic strains were found to 
      be clinically effective in addressing gastrointestinal infectious diseases, the 
      common cold and flu. However, the mechanism by which probiotics exerted their 
      antiviral effects remained relatively unclear during that period. Nevertheless, 
      probiotics, Lactococcus lactis strain Plasma (LC-Plasma), and others have gained 
      attention for their unique ability to modulate the immune system and demonstrate 
      antiviral properties. While some probiotics have shown promise in alleviating 
      gastrointestinal symptoms linked to COVID-19, their direct effectiveness in 
      treating or preventing COVID-19 progression has not yet been conclusively 
      established. As we transition into the post-COVID-19 era, the relationship 
      between COVID-19 and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), a vital component of 
      the innate immune system, has been gradually elucidated. These findings are now 
      being applied in developing novel vaccines and treatments involving interferons 
      and in immune activation research using probiotics as adjuvants, comparable to 
      CpG-DNA through TLR9. The role of the local innate immune system, including pDCs, 
      as the first line of defense against viral infections has gained increasing 
      interest. Moving forward, insight of the immune system and the crosstalk between 
      probiotics and the innate immune system is expected to highlight the role of 
      probiotics in adjunctive immunoregulatory therapy. In combination with drug 
      treatments, probiotics may play a more substantial role in enhancing immune 
      responses. The immunoregulatory approach using probiotics such as LC-Plasma, 
      which can induce anti-infectious factors such as interferons, holds promise as a 
      viable therapeutic and prophylactic option against viral infectious diseases due 
      to their good safety profile and protective efficacy.

TI  - What have we learned from the first to the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic? An 
      international survey from the ESCMID Study Group for Infection in the Elderly 
      (ESGIE) group.
PG  - 281-288
LID - 10.1007/s10096-021-04377-1 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this survey is to explore changes in the management of COVID-19 
      during the first versus the second wave, with particular emphasis on therapies, 
      antibiotic prescriptions, and elderly care. An internet-based questionnaire 
      survey was distributed to European Society of Clinical Microbiology and 
      Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) members. Therapeutic approach to patients with 
      mild-to-moderate (PiO(2)/FiO(2) 200-350) and severe (PiO(2)/FiO(2) < 200) 
      COVID-19, antibiotic use, and reasons for excluding patients from the intensive 
      care unit (ICU) were investigated. A total of 463 from 21 countries participated 
      in the study. Most representatives were infectious disease specialists (68.3%). 
      During the second wave of pandemic, physicians abandoned the use of 
      hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and azithromycin in favor of 
      dexamethasone, low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and remdesivir in 
      mild-to-moderate COVID-19. In critically ill patients, we detected an increased 
      use of high-dose steroids (51%) and a decrease in tocilizumab use. The use of 
      antibiotics at hospital admission decreased but remained high in the second wave. 
      Age was reported to be a main consideration for exclusion of patients from ICU 
      care by 25% of responders; a third reported that elderly were not candidates for 
      ICU admission in their center. The decision to exclude patients from ICU care was 
      based on the individual decision of an intensivist in 59.6% of cases. The 
      approach of physicians to COVID-19 changed over time following evidence 
      accumulation and guidelines. Antibiotic use at hospital admission and decision to 
      exclude patients from ICU care remain critical aspects that should be better 
      investigated and harmonized among clinicians.

TI  - Treatment patterns and visual acuity change of AMD patients, before, during and 
      after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns: A large cohort.
PG  - e322-e327
LID - 10.1111/aos.15756 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of the changes in treatment patterns before, 
      during and after the COVID-19 pandemic on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in 
      previously treated neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) patients. 
      METHODS: A multi-centre, retrospective, observational study of consecutive nAMD 
      patients during 2019-2021. Data collected included demographics, BCVA, dates of 
      intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections and 
      clinic visits. RESULTS: A total of 1652 eyes of 1652 nAMD patients were included, 
      out of which 850 eyes were assessed in 2019 (pre-COVID-19), 630 eyes were 
      assessed in 2020 (COVID-19) and 974 eyes were assessed in 2021 (post-COVID-19). 
      During the COVID-19 period, the mean number of anti-VEGF injections was 
      significantly lower than the corresponding pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods 
      (5.55 compared to 6.13 and 6.60, respectively p < 0.01). A constant lower ratio 
      of injections per patient/month was observed during COVID-19 compared to previous 
      and following years, with a notable decline during March-April, reaching a ratio 
      of 0.4 in 2020 versus 0.65 in 2019 and 0.62 in 2021 (p < 0.01). Baseline BCVA 
      (0.825, p < 0.001), number of injections (-0.007, p < 0.001), gender (-0.027, 
      p = 0.037) and age (0.004, p < 0.001) were shown to be significant predictors of 
      final BCVA. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 period, patients were treated with 
      significantly less intravitreal anti-VEGF injection compared to the previous year 
      with compensation in the following year. These changes in treatment patterns did 
      not have a significant impact on BCVA outcomes. Age, gender, baseline BCVA and 
      number of injections are predictors of final visual outcomes.

TI  - Changes in Spermatogenesis, Lipoperoxidation Processes, and Antioxidant 
      Protection in Men with Pathozoospermia after COVID-19. The Effectiveness of 
      Correction with a Promising Antioxidant Complex.
PG  - 606-610

AB  - The indicators of spermatogenesis and the state of LPO and antioxidant protection 
      in men with pathozoospermia after COVID-19 were assessed before and after 
      treatment an antioxidant complex. Blood plasma served as the material for 
      biochemical studies. In the examined patients, the parameters of spermatogenesis, 
      as well as blood concentration of LPO components (diene conjugates and 
      TBA-reactive substances) were analyzed. The total antioxidant activity of the 
      blood was determined as an indicator characterizing the total activity of LPO 
      inhibitors and determining its buffer capacity. In patients recovered from 
      COVID-19, an increase in spermatogenesis disorders and shifts towards the 
      predominance of prooxidant factors were observed. After a course (1 month) of 
      antioxidant complex, patients showed increased sperm motility, decreased 
      leukocyte count in the ejaculate, and restored balance in the 
      prooxidant-antioxidant system towards antioxidant components. The effectiveness 
      of correction of post-COVID disorders largely depends on the degree of damage to 
      the structure and function of cell membranes caused by oxidative stress. The use 
      of the antioxidant complex is a promising option, because it reduces the level of 
      LPO, enhances antioxidant protection of the body, and also normalizes some 
      parameters of spermatogenesis.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine can alter the body's immunological balance 
      leading to autoimmune disease in rare cases. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody 
      (ANCA)-associated vasculitis is one of the autoimmune diseases which have been 
      rarely reported to appear post-COVID-19 vaccine. Herein, we report the case of a 
      47-year-old woman who developed acute renal failure few days after receiving the 
      first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Corticosteroids along with 
      azathioprine were used for the management.

AB  - Memory B cells (MBCs) are key providers of long-lived immunity against infectious 
      disease, yet in chronic viral infection, they do not produce effective 
      protection. How chronic viral infection disrupts MBC development and whether such 
      changes are reversible remain unknown. Through single-cell (sc)ATAC-seq and 
      scRNA-seq during acute versus chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis viral 
      infection, we identified a memory subset enriched for interferon (IFN)-stimulated 
      genes (ISGs) during chronic infection that was distinct from the T-bet(+) subset 
      normally associated with chronic infection. Blockade of IFNAR-1 early in 
      infection transformed the chromatin landscape of chronic MBCs, decreasing 
      accessibility at ISG-inducing transcription factor binding motifs and inducing 
      phenotypic changes in the dominating MBC subset, with a decrease in the ISG 
      subset and an increase in CD11c(+)CD80(+) cells. However, timing was critical, 
      with MBCs resistant to intervention at 4 weeks post-infection. Together, our 
      research identifies a key mechanism to instruct MBC identity during viral 
      infection.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A 
      virus (IAV) represent two highly transmissible airborne pathogens with pandemic 
      capabilities. Although these viruses belong to separate virus families-SARS-CoV-2 
      is a member of the family Coronaviridae, while IAV is a member of the family 
      Orthomyxoviridae-both have shown zoonotic potential, with significant animal 
      reservoirs in species in close contact with humans. The two viruses are similar 
      in their capacity to infect human airways, and coinfections resulting in 
      significant morbidity and mortality have been documented. Here, we investigate 
      the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 and influenza H1N1 
      A/California/04/2009 virus during coinfection. Competition assays in vitro were 
      performed in susceptible cells that were either interferon type I/III 
      (IFN-I/-III) nonresponsive or IFN-I/-III responsive, in addition to an in vivo 
      golden hamster model. We find that SARS-CoV-2 infection does not interfere with 
      IAV biology in vivo, regardless of timing between the infections. In contrast, we 
      observe a significant loss of SARS-CoV-2 replication following IAV infection. The 
      latter phenotype correlates with increased levels of IFN-I/-III and immune 
      priming that interferes with the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Together, 
      these data suggest that cocirculation of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV is unlikely to result 
      in increased severity of disease. IMPORTANCE The human population now has two 
      circulating respiratory RNA viruses with high pandemic potential, namely, 
      SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. As both viruses infect the airways and can 
      result in significant morbidity and mortality, it is imperative that we also 
      understand the consequences of getting coinfected. Here, we demonstrate that the 
      host response to influenza A virus uniquely interferes with SARS-CoV-2 biology 
      although the inverse relationship is not evident. Overall, we find that the host 
      response to both viruses is comparable to that to SARS-CoV-2 infection alone.

AB  - Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late 2019 and early 
      2020, the identification of drugs to control severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its symptoms has been a pressing focus 
      of research. Cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are 
      the leading causes of mortality following infection. In this review, we discuss 
      immune pathogenesis and four medications, including Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, 
      Dexamethasone, and Annual SZ for COVID-19. A comparison of the effectiveness and 
      therapeutic usage of drugs as reported in clinical trials and reports was made at 
      different disease levels as well. Clinical studies indicate that Annual SZ with 
      mild side effects was more affordable and might be more effective than other 
      medications. Additionally, Annual SZ was capable of reducing the levels of 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as viral attachment and RNA replication.

TI  - Prevalence and impact of COVID-19 sequelae on treatment and survival of patients 
      with cancer who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection: evidence from the OnCovid 
      retrospective, multicentre registry study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The medium-term and long-term impact of COVID-19 in patients with 
      cancer is not yet known. In this study, we aimed to describe the prevalence of 
      COVID-19 sequelae and their impact on the survival of patients with cancer. We 
      also aimed to describe patterns of resumption and modifications of systemic 
      anti-cancer therapy following recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: 
      OnCovid is an active European registry study enrolling consecutive patients aged 
      18 years or older with a history of solid or haematological malignancy and who 
      had a diagnosis of RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this retrospective 
      study, patients were enrolled from 35 institutions across Belgium, France, 
      Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. Patients who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 
      infection between Feb 27, 2020, and Feb 14, 2021, and entered into the registry 
      at the point of data lock (March 1, 2021), were eligible for analysis. The 
      present analysis was focused on COVID-19 survivors who underwent clinical 
      reassessment at each participating institution. We documented prevalence of 
      COVID-19 sequelae and described factors associated with their development and 
      their association with post-COVID-19 survival, which was defined as the interval 
      from post-COVID-19 reassessment to the patients' death or last follow-up. We also 
      evaluated resumption of systemic anti-cancer therapy in patients treated within 4 
      weeks of COVID-19 diagnosis. The OnCovid study is registered in 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04393974. FINDINGS: 2795 patients diagnosed with 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection between Feb 27, 2020, and Feb 14, 2021, were entered into 
      the study by the time of the data lock on March 1, 2021. After the exclusion of 
      ineligible patients, the final study population consisted of 2634 patients. 1557 
      COVID-19 survivors underwent a formal clinical reassessment after a median of 
      22·1 months (IQR 8·4-57·8) from cancer diagnosis and 44 days (28-329) from 
      COVID-19 diagnosis. 234 (15·0%) patients reported COVID-19 sequelae, including 
      respiratory symptoms (116 [49·6%]) and residual fatigue (96 [41·0%]). Sequelae 
      were more common in men (vs women; p=0·041), patients aged 65 years or older (vs 
      other age groups; p=0·048), patients with two or more comorbidities (vs one or 
      none; p=0·0006), and patients with a history of smoking (vs no smoking history; 
      p=0·0004). Sequelae were associated with hospitalisation for COVID-19 (p<0·0001), 
      complicated COVID-19 (p<0·0001), and COVID-19 therapy (p=0·0002). With a median 
      post-COVID-19 follow-up of 128 days (95% CI 113-148), COVID-19 sequelae were 
      associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 1·80 [95% CI 
      1·18-2·75]) after adjusting for time to post-COVID-19 reassessment, sex, age, 
      comorbidity burden, tumour characteristics, anticancer therapy, and COVID-19 
      severity. Among 466 patients on systemic anti-cancer therapy, 70 (15·0%) 
      permanently discontinued therapy, and 178 (38·2%) resumed treatment with a dose 
      or regimen adjustment. Permanent treatment discontinuations were independently 
      associated with an increased risk of death (HR 3·53 [95% CI 1·45-8·59]), but dose 
      or regimen adjustments were not (0·84 [0·35-2·02]). INTERPRETATION: Sequelae 
      post-COVID-19 affect up to 15% of patients with cancer and adversely affect 
      survival and oncological outcomes after recovery. Adjustments to systemic 
      anti-cancer therapy can be safely pursued in treatment-eligible patients.

TI  - Catalase Activity of IgGs of Patients Infected with SARS-CoV-2.
LID - 10.3390/ijms241210081 [doi]
LID - 10081
AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, leads to 
      various manifestations of the post-COVID syndrome, including diabetes, heart and 
      kidney disease, thrombosis, neurological and autoimmune diseases and, therefore, 
      remains, so far, a significant public health problem. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 
      infection can lead to the hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
      causing adverse effects on oxygen transfer efficiency, iron homeostasis, and 
      erythrocytes deformation, contributing to thrombus formation. In this work, the 
      relative catalase activity of the serum IgGs of patients recovered from COVID-19, 
      healthy volunteers vaccinated with Sputnik V, vaccinated with Sputnik V after 
      recovering from COVID-19, and conditionally healthy donors were analyzed for the 
      first time. Previous reports show that along with canonical antioxidant enzymes, 
      the antibodies of mammals with superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase 
      activities are involved in controlling reactive oxygen species levels. We here 
      show that the IgGs from patients who recovered from COVID-19 had the highest 
      catalase activity, and this was statistically significantly higher each compared 
      to the healthy donors (1.9-fold), healthy volunteers vaccinated with Sputnik V 
      (1.4-fold), and patients vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19 (2.1-fold). 
      These data indicate that COVID-19 infection may stimulate the production of 
      antibodies that degrade hydrogen peroxide, which is harmful at elevated 
      concentrations.

TI  - Early nintedanib deployment in COVID-19 interstitial lung disease (ENDCOV-I): 
      study protocol of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
LID - 10.1136/bmjresp-2024-002323 [doi]
LID - e002323
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, the novel SARS-CoV-2 triggered a global pneumonia 
      outbreak, leading to millions of deaths worldwide. A subset of survivors faces 
      increased morbidity and mortality, particularly due to subacute lung injury 
      evolving to chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease. While nintedanib, a 
      tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, shows promise in treating progressive fibrotic lung 
      disease, limited randomised trial data exists for post-COVID-19-induced lung 
      injury. We hypothesise that treatment with nintedanib may attenuate advancement 
      to the fibrotic stages, offering a potential avenue for improving outcomes in 
      this specific patient subset. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We describe the design of a 
      multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 
      approximately 170 patients with subacute lung injury secondary to COVID-19, who 
      required respiratory support with oxygen supplementation. Patients are randomised 
      by site and disease phenotype (fibrotic vs non-fibrotic) in a 1:1 ratio to either 
      oral nintedanib or placebo. Patients will be followed for 180 days. The primary 
      endpoint is to assess change from baseline in forced vital capacity (FVC, mL) at 
      180 days. Secondary objectives include change in FVC (mL) at 90 days; diffusing 
      capacity of carbon monoxide (% of predicted) and 6-min walk test (feet) at 180 
      days; and mortality at 90 and 180 days. Qualitative and quantitative changes in 
      high-resolution computerised tomography (HRCT), change in patient-reported 
      outcome measures (PROMs) and safety endpoints will also be assessed. Analysis 
      will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: The study is conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical 
      Practices as outlined by the Food and Drug Administration and the Declaration of 
      Helsinki 2008. This study received approval from participating sites' 
      Institutional Review Boards and committees, including The Ethics Committee of the 
      Medical Board at the Mount Sinai Hospital (ID: HS#20-01166). The Independent 
      Oversight Committee oversees study conduct, data and patient safety for the 
      duration of the study investigation. The trial details presented align with the 
      trial protocol V.8. (April 2022). Results will be presented at national and 
      international conferences, published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated 
      to patients, funders and researchers on data analysis completion. TRIAL

TI  - Post-coronavirus disease bilateral endogenous fungal endophthalmitis with full 
      visual acuity recovery: a case report.
PG  - 532
LID - 10.1186/s13256-025-05569-5 [doi]
LID - 532
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing reports and case series describe cases of endogenous 
      endophthalmitis (EE) following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      infection. Endogenous endophthalmitis is a severe ophthalmologic pathology caused 
      by bacteremic or fungemic seeding of the eye, often in immunocompromised 
      patients. Delayed treatment can lead to permanent visual impairment. We report 
      the diagnosis and management of a case of fungal endogenous endophthalmitis with 
      voriconazole and surgery that led to complete visual acuity recovery. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: We present a case of post-coronavirus disease 2019 bilateral fungal 
      endogenous endophthalmitis due to Candida albicans in a 64-year-old Caucasian 
      male patient. Upon arrival, he had a visual acuity of 6/200 and slow pupillary 
      light reflex. Ocular examination revealed conjunctival hyperemia, keratic 
      precipitates, moderate vitritis with cotton wool spots, intraretinal hemorrhages, 
      and foci of chorioretinitis. CONCLUSION: Treatment for endogenous endophthalmitis 
      is often delayed because cultures frequently yield negative results. Early 
      diagnosis is key for better outcomes in endogenous endophthalmitis. This case 
      highlights the need for a high index of suspicion for endogenous endophthalmitis 
      in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 to ensure early diagnosis and timely 
      intervention.

AB  - Interferon-beta (IFN-β) for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is turning 30. The COVID-19 
      pandemic rejuvenated the interest in interferon biology in health and disease, 
      opening translational opportunities beyond neuroinflammation. The antiviral 
      properties of this molecule are in accord with the hypothesis of a viral etiology 
      of MS, for which a credible culprit has been identified in the Epstein-Barr 
      Virus. Likely, IFNs are crucial in the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as 
      demonstrated by inherited and acquired impairments of the interferon response 
      that predispose to a severe COVID-19 course. Accordingly, IFN-β exerted 
      protection against SARS-CoV-2 in people with MS (pwMS). In this viewpoint, we 
      summarize the evidence on IFN-β mechanisms of action in MS with a focus on its 
      antiviral properties, especially against EBV. We synopsize the role of IFNs in 
      COVID-19 and the opportunities and challenges of IFN-β usage for this condition. 
      Finally, we leverage the lessons learned in the pandemic to suggest a role of 
      IFN-β in long-COVID-19 and in special MS subpopulations.

AB  - A 70-year-old Japanese man contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and required oxygen to maintain oxygen 
      saturation (>90%), 5 weeks after onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      symptoms. Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy revealed pathological features of 
      organizing pneumonia with alveolar epithelial injury, and prednisolone 
      administration led to alleviation of respiratory symptoms and recovery of 
      respiratory function. This case report is the first to demonstrate the use of 
      corticosteroids to successfully treat post-COVID-19 respiratory failure in a 
      patient with biopsy-proven organizing pneumonia. We propose that steroid 
      treatment be considered for patients with persistent respiratory dysfunction as 
      COVID-19 pneumonia sequelae.

TI  - An updated patent review of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors 
      (2021-present).
PG  - 631-649

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are strongly interlinked with the 
      progression and mechanisms of several life-threatening diseases including cancer. 
      Thus, novel MMP inhibitors (MMPIs) as promising drug candidates can be effective 
      in combating these diseases. However, no MMPIs are marketed to date due to poor 
      pharmacokinetics and lower selectivity. Therefore, this review was performed to 
      study the newer MMPIs patented after the COVID-19 period for an updated 
      perspective on MMPIs. AREAS COVERED: This review highlights patents related to 
      MMPIs, and their therapeutic implications published between January 2021 and 
      August 2023 available in the Google Patents, Patentscope, and Espacenet 
      databases. EXPERT OPINION: Despite various MMP-related patents disclosed up to 
      2020, newer patent applications in the post-COVID-19 period decreased a lot. 
      Besides major MMPs, other isoforms (i.e. MMP-3 and MMP-7) have gained attention 
      recently for drug development. This may open up newer dimensions targeting these 
      MMPs for therapeutic advancements. The isoform selectivity and bioavailability 
      are major concerns for effective MMPI development. Thus, adopting theoretical 
      approaches and experimental methodologies can unveil the development of novel 
      MMPIs with improved pharmacokinetic profiles. Nevertheless, the involvement of 
      MMPs in cancer, and the mechanisms of such MMPs in other diseases should be 
      extensively studied for novel MMPI development.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) 
      protein mediates canonical cell entry via ACE2 and has also been implicated as an 
      activator of a diverse range of signaling pathways. Here, we present evidence 
      that the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the 
      S1 fragment of the S protein induces TGF-β cytokine expression. RGD peptides are 
      well characterized as ligands for a subset of integrin complexes primarily 
      containing α5 and αV subunits. In this study, we investigate the molecular basis 
      of TGF-β pathway activation by S protein, delivered to cells as recombinant 
      protein, in pseudotyped virus or in virally infected cells. Activation of TGF-β 
      signaling by the S protein requires ACE2 and leads to SMAD3-dependent expression 
      of the pro-fibrotic marker PAI-1. Utilizing pseudotyped viruses, expression of 
      the S protein with a mutated RGD motif abolished TGF-β signaling, as did the RGD 
      antagonist ATN-161, implicating integrin complexes in mediating this response. We 
      show that the S protein RGD motif suppresses IFN-β expression via TGF-β, leading 
      to a disruption in cellular antiviral defenses, consistent with TGF-β's role in 
      immunosuppression. These findings further support the multifunctionality of S 
      protein and provide mechanistic insights into its activity as a virulence factor 
      during infection. IMPORTANCE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) presents an ongoing public health challenge as a cause of acute 
      illness and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC, or long COVID). Our study 
      identifies the RGD integrin-binding motif in the spike (S) protein as central to 
      the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2, leading to the expression of the pleiotropic 
      cytokine TGF-β and disabling of antiviral immunity. This work further supports 
      the S protein-to-integrin complex signaling axis as a potential therapeutic 
      target. The RGD motif might also be a valid target for treating PASC given the 
      increasing body of evidence implicating the presence of persistent S protein in 
      the etiology of this disease.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins (APs), particularly ORF3a and ORF9b, have emerged 
      as key modulators of host-pathogen interaction and potential contributors to long 
      COVID. Of the 13 predicted APs, only nine are expressed during infection - termed 
      Infection-related APs - while the remaining are classified as Putative APs. 
      Despite this distinction, extensive gene overlap among APs underscores the 
      remarkable adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. This review delves into the 
      diverse roles of the original Wuhan APs and their Omicron counterparts in shaping 
      host immunity, with an emphasis on their ability to suppress type I interferon 
      (IFN-I) signalling, modulate cellular metabolism, and trigger 
      inflammatory/apoptotic pathways. By integrating immunopathological insights with 
      evolutionary dynamics and structural perspectives, this review provides a 
      comprehensive understanding of the mechanism underlying Omicron's reduced 
      pathogenicity and highlights promising, yet unexplored, therapeutic targets 
      within the SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteome.

AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate factors influencing the time to 
      return to work (RTW) of HealthCare Workers (HCW) infected with COVID-19 during 
      the initial wave of the pandemic in a southern French university hospital. Data 
      collection of 170 HCW (between March 16 to June 1, 2020) included demographic and 
      professional information, clinical profiles, comorbidities, medical management, 
      therapies and RT-PCR results. The mean time to RTW was 15.6 days. Multivariate 
      analyses revealed that the time to RTW was shorter among laboratory and emergency 
      workers, while it was longer for HCW aged 40 to 49 years, at higher risk of 
      severe illness, with a delayed negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR or those treated with 
      azithromycin and/or hydroxychloroquine. This study highlights diverse factors 
      affecting HCW RTW post-COVID-19 infection, underscoring the importance of 
      exercising caution in administering unproven therapies to HCW during the early 
      stages of a novel infectious pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic affecting all 
      countries in the world. Italy has been particularly afflicted by the health 
      emergency, and since the peak phase has passed, major concern regarding medium to 
      long term complications due to COVID-19 is arising. Little is known in literature 
      regarding thromboembolic complications once healed after COVID-19. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old patient recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia complicated 
      by pulmonary embolism (PE) came to the hospital for palpitations and chest pain. 
      Although he was on treatment dose of direct oral anticoagulation (DOAC), massive 
      recurrent PE was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: In the early post COVID-19 era, the 
      question remains regarding the efficacy of DOACs in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - In the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, Belgian health authorities endorsed 
      the interim guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia: 
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) recommended for treatment of hospitalized patients with 
      moderate to severe disease. As a growing number of patients were admitted, 
      inevitably, our internal medicine team questioned the efficacy and safety of HCQ, 
      especially with regard to cardiac side effects. In parallel with our concerns, 
      data regarding the safety and efficacy of HCQ were published, with discordant 
      results and debate in the medical community. Media coverage of the possible risks 
      and benefits of HCQ use in COVID-19 also caused confusion amongst the public. In 
      this Perspectives in Rheumatology article, we review the use and safety of HCQ in 
      autoimmune disease and its putative efficacy and toxicity in COVID-19. Finally, 
      we share our concern about the future of this widely used and inexpensive drug 
      after the COVID-19 pandemic has passed.

TI  - Post-COVID-19 fatal Aspergillus endocarditis: A case report.
PG  - e24816

LID - e24816
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aspergillus endocarditis (AE) is a rare fatal infection. The 
      infection is often reported in patients with prosthetic heart valves, 
      immunosuppressed, broad-spectrum antimicrobial use regimens, and drug abusers. 
      METHODS: Herein, we report a rare case of native mitral valve AE in a 63-year-old 
      man, with a probable COVID-19-associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis nine 
      months ago treated with antifungals. RESULTS: In the last admission, the 
      lethargy, neurological deficit, and septic-embolic brain abscess in brain MRI led 
      to suspicion of infective endocarditis. Transesophageal two-dimensional 
      echocardiography and color Doppler flow velocity mapping showed a large highly 
      mobile mass destroying leaflet and severe mitral regurgitation. The Surgical 
      valve replacement is performed. The surgical valve replacement is performed. 
      Direct microscopic examination and culture of the explanted and vegetative mass 
      revealed Aspergillus section Fumiagati confirmed by molecular method. Despite the 
      administration of voriconazole and transient improvement the patient expired. 
      CONCLUSION: As AE is a late consequence of COVID-19-associated invasive pulmonary 
      aspergillosis, therefore, long-term follow-up of invasive aspergillosis, and 
      prompt diagnosis of surgical and systemic antifungal therapy treatment, are 
      warranted to provide robust management.

TI  - [Therapeutic possibilities of stimulating reparative neurogenesis in patients 
      with glaucoma who have recovered from a coronavirus infection].
PG  - 44-51
LID - 10.17116/oftalma202313902144 [doi]
AB  - In patients with glaucoma, the neuroplasticity of retinal cells, their axons and 
      neuroglial elements is pathogenetically reduced, including due to a decrease in 
      the concentration of neurotrophic factors. Coronavirus infections contribute to 
      the damage processes, causing apoptosis of retinal and optic nerve cells. In this 
      regard, the possibility of pharmacological stimulation of the production of these 
      peptides through energy potentiation of the cell mitochondria function, reduction 
      of oxidative stress severity and activation of interneuronal transduction system 
      becomes relevant. PURPOSE: This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive diagnosis 
      of the severity of oxidative stress, identify changes in the neuroplasticity and 
      reparative ability of the retina in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma 
      (POAG) who have recovered after a coronavirus infection, and are undergoing 
      therapy with the complex drug Cytoflavin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study 
      included 40 patients (mean age 57.2±3.6 years) with advanced POAG compensated by 
      hypotensive agents; all of them recovered from moderate Covid-19 30 to 90 days 
      prior to inclusion in the study. Twenty patients of the main group received 
      therapy with the complex drug Cytoflavin, 20 other patients comprised the control 
      group. In the comparison groups, the concentration of BDNF and CNTF in blood 
      serum (SC) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Overall 
      assessment of oxidative stress was done by high performance liquid 
      chromatography. Studies of the functional activity of the retina were performed 
      using the Tomey EP 1000 electroretinograph according to the standard method. 
      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Retinal photosensitivity significantly improved in 
      patients of the main group taking the complex drug Cytoflavin (mD mean after 
      treatment increased from -7.34±0.62 dB to -4.52±0.12 dB (p>0.001), PSD mean 
      decreased from 6.23±0.21dB to 4.27±0.13 dB (p>0.001)); the neural activity of the 
      retina improved according to PERG (the amplitudes of the P50 and N95 components 
      increased from 0.92±0.04 µv to 1.65±0.01 µv and from 1.83±0.06 µv to 2.68±0.01 
      µv, respectively (p>0.001), the latency of the P50 and N95 components decreased 
      from 53.40±2.51 ms to 49.37±2.22 ms and from 112.40±5.23 ms to 107.4±8.11ms, 
      respectively (p>0.001); the concentration of BDNF increased (from 18.65±5.32 
      ng/ml to 20.23±4.05 ng/ml (p>0.001)) and the concentration of CNTF in the blood 
      serum decreased (from 3.99±0.37 pg/ml to 1.85±0.02pg/ml (p>0.001)), the severity 
      of oxidative stress decreased (the indicator of oxidative stress decreased by 1.4 
      times after treatment p>0.001) and the content of antioxidant protection 
      indicators increased: the indicator of antioxidant protection of blood serum 
      increased by 1.4 times, the concentration of superoxide dismutase - by 1.9 times 
      (p>0.001), glutathione peroxidase - by 1.4 times (p>0.001), coenzyme Q10 - by 4.5 
      times (p>0.001). CONCLUSION: The obtained data can be used to determine the risk 
      of progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in patients with glaucoma who 
      have had a coronavirus infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive deficits are increasingly recognized as a 
      long-term sequela of severe COVID-19. The underlying processes and molecular 
      signatures associated with these long-term neurological sequalae of COVID-19 
      remain largely unclear, but may be related to systemic inflammation-induced 
      effects on the brain. We studied the systemic inflammation-brain interplay and 
      its relation to development of long-term cognitive impairment in patients who 
      survived severe COVID-19. Trajectories of systemic inflammation and neuroaxonal 
      damage blood biomarkers during ICU admission were analyzed and related to 
      long-term cognitive outcomes. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal cohort study of 
      patients with severe COVID-19 surviving ICU admission. During admission, blood 
      was sampled consecutively to assess levels of inflammatory cytokines and 
      neurofilament light chain (NfL) using an ultrasensitive multiplex Luminex assay 
      and single molecule array technique (Simoa). Cognitive functioning was evaluated 
      using a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment six months after 
      ICU-discharge. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients (median [IQR] age 61 [55-69] years) 
      were enrolled from March 2020 to June 2021 and divided into two cohorts: those 
      who received no COVID-19-related immunotherapy (n = 28) and those treated with 
      either dexamethasone or dexamethasone and tocilizumab (n = 68). Plasma NfL 
      concentrations increased in 95 % of patients during their ICU stay, from median 
      [IQR] 23 [18-38] pg/mL at admission to 250 [160-271] pg/mL after 28 days, 
      p < 0.001. Besides age, glomerular filtration rate, immunomodulatory treatment, 
      and C-reactive protein, more specific markers of systemic inflammation at day 14 
      (i.e., interleukin (IL)-8, tumour necrosis factor, and IL-1 receptor antagonist) 
      were significant predictors of blood NfL levels at day 14 of ICU admission 
      (R(2) = 44 %, p < 0.001), illustrating the association between sustained systemic 
      inflammation and neuroaxonal damage. Twenty-six patients (27 %) exhibited 
      cognitive impairment six months after discharge from the ICU. NfL concentrations 
      showed a more pronounced increase in patients that developed cognitive impairment 
      (p = 0.03). Higher NfL predicted poorer outcome in information processing speed 
      (Trail Making Test A, r = -0.26, p = 0.01; Letter Digit Substitution Test, 
      r = -0.24, p = 0.02). DISCUSSION: Prolonged systemic inflammation in critically 
      ill COVID-19 patients is related to neuroaxonal damage and subsequent long-term 
      cognitive impairment. Moreover, our findings suggest that plasma NfL 
      concentrations during ICU stay may possess prognostic value in predicting future 
      long-term cognitive impairment in patients that survived severe COVID-19.

AB  - We report the first documented case of renal sarcoidosis developing after 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient, a 59-year-old woman with no significant 
      medical history, was diagnosed with COVID-19 after experiencing persistent 
      fatigue and insomnia. Approximately three weeks after the infection, she 
      developed a skin rash, prompting a biopsy that revealed epithelioid granulomas. A 
      systemic evaluation using computed tomography identified enlarged bilateral hilar 
      lymph nodes, and a needle aspiration biopsy confirmed the presence of epithelioid 
      granulomas, leading to a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Nine months after recovering 
      from COVID-19, she was referred to the nephrology department due to progressive 
      renal dysfunction. A renal biopsy demonstrated granulomatous interstitial 
      nephritis with Schaumann bodies, consistent with renal sarcoidosis. Treatment 
      with prednisolone (30 mg/day, 0.5 mg/kg/day) resulted in significant improvement 
      in renal function, suggesting a potential link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
      immune dysregulation. This case highlights the importance of monitoring renal 
      function in patients with post-COVID-19 sarcoidosis, even in the absence of 
      disease progression in other organs.

AB  - The clinical spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still not fully 
      understood. Cancer patients are uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19, and many have 
      been or will be infected. Although an unfortunate minority will die from the 
      infection, most will recover. This poses a challenge in which clinicians must 
      weigh the benefits of initiation or resumption of antineoplastic therapy against 
      the risks that antineoplastic treatment may worsen outcomes related to COVID-19 
      infection. A recent study of 423 patients at our institution found that patients 
      in active cancer treatment who develop COVID-19 infection did not fare any worse 
      than other hospitalized patients, yet guidance as to who requires testing prior 
      to antineoplastic therapy and when to resume therapy post-COVID-19 diagnosis 
      remains unknown. Our institution, therefore, commissioned a task force to help 
      create guidelines for treating oncologists using available published literature. 
      The task force focused on the ambulatory care testing guidelines only, because 
      all inpatients receiving antineoplastic therapy are tested for COVID-19 prior to 
      hospital admission. The guidelines focus solely on the safety and well-being of 
      the individual patient undergoing antineoplastic therapy and are not designed to 
      address infection control issues.

AB  - Abnormal wound healing and dysregulated inflammation in the lung results in 
      scarring and progressive fibrosis, which are hallmarks of Idiopathic Pulmonary 
      Fibrosis (IPF) and post-COVID injury-related lung fibrosis. Chemokine signaling 
      through the CXCR3 receptor and the CXCR3-activating chemokine interferon 
      gamma-inducible protein of 10kD (CXCL10/IP10) have been implicated in the 
      regulation of pulmonary fibrosis with full length CXCL10 preventing pulmonary 
      fibrosis development in preclinical models. Therapeutic use of full length 
      CXCL10p has been limited by protein instability in vivo. To address this 
      challenge, we utilized a CXCL10 activating peptide (CXCL10p) and found that 
      CXCL10p prevents lung fibrosis and inflammation in the bleomycin mouse model. Our 
      findings suggest that CXCL10p may have improved therapeutic potential for the 
      prevention progressive fibrotic lung diseases such as IPF and acute lung 
      injury-related lung fibrosis. NEW & NOTEWORTHY : We show that the intratracheal 
      treatment of CXCL10p in a bleomycin-induced lung injury mouse model of pulmonary 
      fibrosis reduces lung fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration. This efficacy 
      is dose- and timing-dependent. This study highlights the improved therapeutic 
      potential of CXCL10p to regulate and reduce pulmonary fibrosis.

      Post-COVID-19.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182111291 [doi]
LID - 11291
AB  - The recent outbreak of respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which 
      causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has led to the widespread use of 
      therapeutics, including dexamethasone (DEXA). DEXA, a synthetic glucocorticoid, 
      is among the widely administered drugs used to treat hospitalized COVID-19 
      patients. The global COVID-19 surge in infections, consequent increasing 
      hospitalizations, and other DEXA applications have raised concerns on eminent 
      adverse ecological implications to aquatic ecosystems. Here, we aim to summarize 
      published studies on DEXA occurrence, fate, and effects on organisms in natural 
      and engineered systems as, pre-COVID, the drug has been identified as an emerging 
      environmental contaminant. The results demonstrated a significant reduction of 
      DEXA in wastewater treatment plants, with a small portion, including its 
      transformation products (TPs), being released into downstream waters. Fish and 
      crustaceans are the most susceptible species to DEXA exposure in the 
      parts-per-billion range, suggesting potential deleterious ecological effects. 
      However, there are data deficits on the implications of DEXA to marine and 
      estuarine systems and wildlife. To improve DEXA management, toxicological 
      outcomes of DEXA and formed TPs should entail long-term studies from whole 
      organisms to molecular effects in actual environmental matrices and at realistic 
      exposure concentrations. This can aid in striking a fine balance of saving human 
      lives and protecting ecological integrity.

AB  - Reduced carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DL(CO) ) is common after recovery 
      from severe COVID-19 pneumonitis. The extent to which this relates to alveolar 
      membrane dysfunction as opposed to vascular injury is uncertain. Simultaneous 
      measurement of nitric oxide diffusing capacity (DL(NO) ) and DL(CO) can partition 
      gas diffusion into its two components: alveolar-capillary membrane conductance 
      (D(mCO) ) and capillary blood volume (V(C) ). We sought to evaluate D(mCO) and 
      V(C) in the early and later recovery periods after severe COVID-19. Patients 
      attended for post-COVID-19 clinical review and lung function testing including 
      DL(NO) /DL(CO) . Repeat testing occurred when indicated and comparisons made 
      using t-tests. Forty-nine (eight female) subjects (mean ± SD age: 58 ± 13, BMI: 
      34 ± 8) who had severe COVID-19 pneumonitis, WHO severity classification of 
      6 ± 1, and prolonged (21 ± 22 days) hospital stay, were assessed 2 months 
      (61 ± 35 days) post discharge. DL(CO) adj (z-score -1.70 ± 1.49, 25/49 < lower 
      limit of normal [LLN]) and total lung capacity (z-score -1.71 ± 1.30) were both 
      reduced. D(mCO) and V(C) and were reduced to a similar extent (z-score 
      -1.19 ± 1.05 and -1.41 ± 1.20, p = 0.4). Seventeen (one female) patients returned 
      for repeat testing 4 months (122 ± 61 days) post discharge. In this subgroup with 
      more impaired lung function, DL(CO) adj improved but remained below LLN (z-score 
      -3.15 ± 0.83 vs. -2.39 ± 0.86, p = 0.01), 5/17 improved to >LNN. D(mCO) improved 
      (z-score -2.05 ± 0.89 vs. -1.41 ± 0.78, p = 0.01) but V(C) was unchanged (z-score 
      -2.51 ± 0.55 vs. -2.29 ± 0.59, p = 0.16). Alveolar membrane conductance is 
      abnormal in the earlier recovery phase following severe COVID-19 but 
      significantly improves. In contrast, reduced V(C) persists. These data raise the 
      possibility that persisting effects of acute vascular injury may contribute to 
      gas diffusion impairment long after severe COVID-19 pneumonitis.

AB  - COVID-19 is a complex disease with short- and long-term respiratory, inflammatory 
      and neurological symptoms that are triggered by the infection with SARS-CoV-2. 
      Invasion of the brain by SARS-CoV-2 has been observed in humans and is postulated 
      to be involved in post-COVID state. Brain infection is particularly pronounced in 
      the K18-hACE2 mouse model of COVID-19. Prevention of brain infection in the acute 
      phase of the disease might thus be of therapeutic relevance to prevent 
      long-lasting symptoms of COVID-19. We previously showed that melatonin or two 
      prescribed structural analogs, agomelatine and ramelteon delay the onset of 
      severe clinical symptoms and improve survival of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 
      mice. Here, we show that treatment of K18-hACE2 mice with melatonin and two 
      melatonin-derived marketed drugs, agomelatine and ramelteon, prevents SARS-CoV-2 
      entry in the brain, thereby reducing virus-induced damage of small cerebral 
      vessels, immune cell infiltration and brain inflammation. Molecular modeling 
      analyses complemented by experimental studies in cells showed that SARS-CoV-2 
      entry in endothelial cells is prevented by melatonin binding to an 
      allosteric-binding site on human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), thus 
      interfering with ACE2 function as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Our findings 
      open new perspectives for the repurposing of melatonergic drugs and its 
      clinically used analogs in the prevention of brain infection by SARS-CoV-2 and 
      COVID-19-related long-term neurological symptoms.

TI  - Hydroxychloroquine as pre-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19 infection among 
      healthcare workers: a prospective cohort study.
PG  - 781-787
LID - 10.1080/14787210.2022.2015326 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine had attracted significant attention in the initial 
      phases of the COVID-19 pandemic but current recommendations do not support its 
      use. However, the evidence against its use as pre-exposure prophylaxis have been 
      of low to moderate quality and have been limited by high risk of bias. METHODS: 
      Following institutional ethics committee approval, healthcare workers (n = 1294) 
      completing their first week-long COVID in-patient duty, subsequent institutional 
      quarantine and RT-PCR testing for COVID-19 infection were included for this 
      prospective cohort study. Demographic data, hydroxychloroquine usage and related 
      adverse effects were captured through a 'Caring for the Caregivers' surveillance 
      system. A chi-Square test of independence was used to determine the effect of 
      hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis. RESULTS: Among the 1294 participants (age: 
      31 ± 7 years, 61% women), 273 (21.1%) healthcare workers used hydroxychloroquine 
      prophylaxis as per Indian Council of Medical Research recommendations and 83/1294 
      (6.4%) tested positive after their duty. There was no significant difference in 
      COVID-19 incidence between those on hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis and those not 
      on it (5.9% vs 6.6%, χ(2) = 0.177, p = 0.675; RR = 0.89, 95% CI - 0.53 to 1.52). 
      There were no significant adverse effects to hydroxychloroquine usage. 
      CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated no benefit of hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis 
      and provides quality evidence against its use in COVID-19 prevention.

TI  - COVID-19 pandemic impact on antibiotics sensitivity of E. coli and K. pneumoniae 
      from urine specimens: a retrospective study.
PG  - 1070-1075
LID - 10.3855/jidc.17615 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae are common organisms 
      associated with urinary tract infections. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a 
      negative impact on antibiotics misuse globally. This study analyzed the 
      antibiotic susceptibility for these two pathogens isolated from urine samples 
      during the period of 18 months before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      METHODOLOGY: This retrospective study was conducted in Al-Karak government 
      referral and teaching hospital in Jordan. The study included two groups; group A 
      included urine samples from September 2018 to March 11, 2020, while group B from 
      March 12, 2020 to August 2021. Samples were analyzed using the automated VITEK 2 
      system and the analysis of results was done using the WHONET version 5.6. 
      RESULTS: A total of 642 E. coli and 113 K. pneumoniae were isolated and analyzed. 
      The antibiogram showed a significant overall increase in antibiotic 
      susceptibility of both bacteria during the pandemic period (group B). The 
      sensitivity has significantly increased by 75% (15/20) and 50% (10/20) for all 
      antibiotics used for E. coli and K. pneumoniae respectively. On the other hand, 
      E. coli showed a significant increase in resistance to ceftriaxone (13.4%) and 
      gentamicin (6.4%). A similar trend of an increase in resistance to gentamicin 
      (17.4%) was also noticed among K. pneumoniae isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      antimicrobial susceptibility pattern for urine isolates showed an increased 
      overall sensitivity and an increased resistance to ceftriaxone and gentamicin 
      during the pandemic period. Our results highlight the need for revising and 
      updating the antimicrobial stewardship programs post-COVID pandemic utilizing 
      local data.

TI  - COVID-19-associated subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.
PG  - 57-64
LID - 10.1111/myc.13369 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Though invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a well known complication 
      of COVID-19 pneumonia, indolent forms of aspergillosis have been rarely 
      described. METHODS: We prospectively collected the clinico-radio-microbiological 
      data of 10 patients of subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (SAIA), who 
      presented to our hospital with recent history of COVID-19 pneumonia along with 
      cavitary lung disease, positive IgG (against Aspergillus) with or without 
      positive respiratory samples for Aspergillus spp. RESULT: The mean age of 
      presentation of SAIA was 50.7 ± 11.8 years. All the patients had recently 
      recovered from severe COVID-19 illness with a mean duration of 29.2 ± 12 days 
      from COVID-19 positivity. Cough was the predominant symptom seen in 8/10 (80%) 
      patients followed by haemoptysis. 7/10 (70%) patients were known diabetic. While 
      serum galactomannan was positive in 5/9 patients (55.5%), fungal culture was 
      positive in 2/7 patients (28.5%) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 
      Aspergillus was positive in three patients. Eight (80%) patients presented with a 
      single cavitary lesion; pseudoaneurysm of pulmonary artery was seen in two 
      patients and post-COVID-19 changes were seen in all patients. All patients were 
      treated with voriconazole, out of which four (40%) patients died during the 
      follow-up period. CONCLUSION: SAIA should be considered in the differential 
      diagnosis of cavitating lung lesions in patients with recent history of COVID-19 
      in the background of steroid use with or without pre-existing diabetes.

AB  - Altered circulating hormone and metabolite levels have been reported during and 
      post-COVID-19. Yet, studies of gene expression at the tissue level capable of 
      identifying the causes of endocrine dysfunctions are lacking. Transcript levels 
      of endocrine-specific genes were analyzed in five endocrine organs of lethal 
      COVID-19 cases. Overall, 116 autoptic specimens from 77 individuals (50 COVID-19 
      cases and 27 uninfected controls) were included. Samples were tested for the 
      SARS-CoV-2 genome. The adrenals, pancreas, ovary, thyroid, and white adipose 
      tissue (WAT) were investigated. Transcript levels of 42 endocrine-specific and 3 
      interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were measured and compared between COVID-19 
      cases (virus-positive and virus-negative in each tissue) and uninfected 
      controls. ISG transcript levels were enhanced in SARS-CoV-2-positive tissues. 
      Endocrine-specific genes (e.g., HSD3B2, INS, IAPP, TSHR, FOXE1, LEP, and CRYGD) 
      were deregulated in COVID-19 cases in an organ-specific manner. Transcription of 
      organ-specific genes was suppressed in virus-positive specimens of the ovary, 
      pancreas, and thyroid but enhanced in the adrenals. In WAT of COVID-19 cases, 
      transcription of ISGs and leptin was enhanced independently of virus detection in 
      tissue. Though vaccination and prior infection have a protective role against 
      acute and long-term effects of COVID-19, clinicians must be aware that endocrine 
      manifestations can derive from virus-induced and/or stress-induced 
      transcriptional changes of individual endocrine genes. KEY MESSAGES: • SARS-CoV-2 
      can infect adipose tissue, adrenals, ovary, pancreas and thyroid. • Infection of 
      endocrine organs induces interferon response. • Interferon response is observed 
      in adipose tissue independently of virus presence. • Endocrine-specific genes are 
      deregulated in an organ-specific manner in COVID-19. • Transcription of crucial 
      genes such as INS, TSHR and LEP is altered in COVID-19.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Driven Discovery of Pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine Derivatives

AB  - Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) has been validated as a promising therapeutic target 
      for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a devastating interstitial lung disease 
      lacking really effective therapeutic drugs, particularly exacerbated in the 
      post-COVID-19 era. Herein, we reported the discovery of 13c, a novel 
      pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-based PDE4 inhibitor, via an innovative artificial 
      intelligence (AI)-driven virtual screening approach integrated with 
      structure-based design. The cocrystal analysis of PDE4-13c elucidated the 
      structural basis of its high affinity, revealing that the unique "halogen-binding 
      and metal-coordination" synergistic network significantly influenced PDE4 
      inhibitory activity, which resulted in a 268-fold potency enhancement (IC(50) = 
      2.7 nM) over hit T3700 (IC(50) = 725 nM). Notably, 13c exhibited remarkable 
      hepatic microsomal stability (RLM(1/2) = 141.4 min). Furthermore, 13c exhibited 
      remarkable antifibrotic activity in vitro and significantly attenuated 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo, highlighting its potential as a 
      novel PDE4 inhibitor for IPF.

      by COVID-19 Infection and/or mRNA Vaccination Are Largely Preserved.
PG  - 2461-2465
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2200175 [doi]
AB  - Several studies have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 variant-of-concern 
      B.1.1.529 (Omicron) exhibits a high degree of escape from Ab neutralization. 
      Therefore, it is critical to determine how well the second line of adaptive 
      immunity, T cell memory, performs against Omicron. To this purpose, we analyzed a 
      human cohort (n = 327 subjects) of two- or three-dose mRNA vaccine recipients and 
      COVID-19 postinfection subjects. We report that T cell responses against Omicron 
      were largely preserved. IFN-γ-producing T cell responses remained equivalent to 
      the response against the ancestral strain (WA1/2020), with some (∼20%) loss in 
      IL-2 single or IL-2(+)IFN-γ(+) polyfunctional responses. Three-dose vaccinated 
      participants had similar responses to Omicron relative to post-COVID-19 
      participants and exhibited responses significantly higher than those receiving 
      two mRNA vaccine doses. These results provide further evidence that a three-dose 
      vaccine regimen benefits the induction of optimal functional T cell immune 
      memory.

TI  - [Biological activity of interferons in the novel coronavirus infection COVID-19].
PG  - 142-152
LID - 10.36233/0507-4088-99 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The immunopathogenesis of the novel coronavirus infection COVID-19 
      is usually associated with the development of imbalance in the immune response to 
      its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2 virus (Coronaviridae: Coronavirinae: 
      Betacoronavirus: Sarbecovirus). This is manifested, in particular, by 
      interferons' (IFNs) deficiency at the beginning of the disease followed by 
      hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The virus causes a decrease in IFN 
      types I (α/β) and III (λ) levels; changes in IFN type II (γ) are less studied. In 
      this regard, it is relevant to assess the functional bioactive IFN (interferon 
      status) in COVID-19. The aim of the study was to assess the antiviral potential 
      of the body by testing the biologically active IFNs in COVID-19. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: We used biological serum samples of COVID-19 patients taken in the acute 
      phase (110 patients on the 1-5 days of the disease) and during rehabilitation (47 
      patients during 1-3 months after the disease onset). Assessment of interferon 
      status was performed according to the technique developed by the authors and 
      described earlier. RESULTS: The IFN status of patients with COVID-19 in the acute 
      period and in the phase of post-infection rehabilitation was studied вduring the 
      observation period. It was found that SARS-CoV-2 causes a pronounced inhibition 
      of biological activity of IFN types I and II compared to the reference values by 
      more than 20 and 7 times, respectively. During the post-COVID period, incomplete 
      recovery of the IFN system activity was registered, which proceeded very slowly. 
      No cases of reaching physiological indicators of interferon status were 
      identified during the observation period. CONCLUSION: The obtained data on 
      deficiency of the functional biologically active IFN confirm the hypothesis about 
      the predominant role of impaired IFN production of different types in the 
      immunopathogenesis of the novel coronavirus infection.

AB  - Depressive disorders are a global mental health challenge that is closely linked 
      to inflammation, especially in the post-COVID-19 era. The JAK-STAT pathway, which 
      is primarily associated with inflammatory responses, is not fully characterized 
      in the context of depressive disorders. Recently, a phase 3 retrospective cohort 
      analysis heightened that the marketed JAK inhibitor tofacitinib is beyond immune 
      diseases and has potential for preventing mood disorders. Inspired by these 
      clinical facts, we investigated the role of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in 
      depression and comprehensively assessed the antidepressant effect of tofacitinib. 
      We found that aberrant activation of the JAK-STAT pathway is highly conserved in 
      the hippocampus of classical depressive mouse models: LPS-induced and chronic 
      social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced depressive mice. Mechanistically, the 
      JAK-STAT pathway mediates proinflammatory cytokine production and microgliosis, 
      leading to synaptic defects in the hippocampus of both depressive models. 
      Remarkably, the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib effectively reverses these phenomena, 
      contributing to its antidepressant effect. These findings indicate that the 
      JAK/STAT pathway could be implicated in depressive disorders, and suggest that 
      the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib has a potential translational implication for 
      preventing mood disorders far beyond its current indications.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Pirfenidone for Mitigation of Interstitial Lung 
      Abnormalities in COVID-19 Patients: A Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 8812779

LID - 8812779
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although post-COVID-19 interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) are 
      common, the use of antifibrotic agents to prevent their onset and progression is 
      controversial. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of 
      pirfenidone to mitigate the onset and progression of ILAs in patients with severe 
      COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched literature published before July 
      21, 2025, from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National 
      Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biology Medicine, Weipu, and Wanfang databases, 
      without language limitation. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that 
      evaluated the effect of pirfenidone on COVID-19-induced ILAs were included. Risk 
      of bias was determined using the Revised Cochrane Randomized Trial Risk Bias Tool 
      Version 2 and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The efficacy and safety of pirfenidone 
      for ILAs in COVID-19 were analyzed by Review Manager 5.4 software. RESULTS: Eight 
      studies were included, comprising 335 patients in pirfenidone treatment groups 
      and 302 controls. Risk of bias ranged from low to moderate. Pirfenidone 
      significantly decreased chest high-resolution CT (HRCT) scores during early- and 
      late-stage COVID-19 and significantly improved forced expiratory volume in 1 s, 
      especially in late-stage COVID-19. Pirfenidone treatment was associated with 
      statistically nonsignificant trends toward improved forced vital capacity and 
      decreased all-cause mortality. Furthermore, HRCT scores, pulmonary function, and 
      inflammatory cytokine levels following pirfenidone treatment were superior to 
      those obtained after glucocorticoid therapy. The incidence of gastrointestinal 
      adverse events was higher in the pirfenidone than the control group, but no 
      serious adverse events or fatalities occurred. CONCLUSION: Pirfenidone therapy 
      may mitigate ILAs and preserve pulmonary function among survivors of COVID-19 
      pneumonia. Furthermore, pirfenidone exhibited acceptable safety and tolerability 
      profiles.

TI  - COVID-19-associated delayed-onset MuSK-positive myasthenia gravis presenting 
      solely with respiratory failure: a case report.
PG  - 1649930
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1649930 [doi]
LID - 1649930
AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) myasthenia gravis is a rare autoimmune 
      disorder of the neuromuscular junction that predominantly affects the bulbar and 
      respiratory muscles. Although SARS-CoV-2 infection has been implicated as a 
      precipitating factor, post-COVID-19 MuSK-MG remains exceedingly uncommon. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old woman with a six-year history of unexplained 
      exertional dyspnea was hospitalised twice for acute hypercapnic respiratory 
      failure. The first episode, five months earlier, was attributed to severe 
      tricuspid regurgitation; the second occurred eight weeks after mild COVID-19 and 
      was characterized by coma due to hypercapnic respiratory failure without 
      parenchymal lung disease. DIAGNOSIS: Standard electrophysiology, neostigmine 
      testing and acetylcholine-receptor antibodies (AChR-Ab) were negative. Given 
      persistent ventilator dependence, MuSK antibodies (MuSK-Ab) were measured and 
      found strongly positive. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent five 
      plasma-exchange sessions, then received oral prednisone (50 mg day), tacrolimus 
      (1.5 mg q12h) and nebulized salbutamol. OUTCOMES: She was weaned from 
      non-invasive ventilation by day 23, discharged on day 27 (mMRC grade I) and 
      remained stable on low-dose prednisone/tacrolimus at three-month follow-up. 
      CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection may plausibly act as a trigger for late-onset 
      MuSK-MG presenting as isolated hypercapnic respiratory failure. In otherwise 
      unexplained weaning failure, neuromuscular-junction disease should be considered 
      even without limb or ocular weakness. Early antibody testing and prompt 
      immunomodulatory therapy [plasma exchange (PLEX) plus glucocorticoid/tacrolimus] 
      may be life-saving and yield rapid recovery.

AB  - As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, reports have demonstrated neurologic 
      sequelae following COVID-19 recovery. Mechanisms to explain long-term 
      neurological sequelae are unknown and need to be identified. Plasma from 24 
      individuals recovering from COVID-19 at 1 to 3 months after initial infection 
      were collected for cytokine and antibody levels and neuronal-enriched 
      extracellular vesicle (nEV) protein cargo analyses. Plasma cytokine IL-4 was 
      increased in all COVID-19 participants. Volunteers with self-reported 
      neurological problems (nCoV, n = 8) had a positive correlation of IL6 with age or 
      severity of the sequalae, at least one co-morbidity and increased SARS-CoV-2 
      antibody compared to those COVID-19 individuals without neurological issues (CoV, 
      n = 16). Protein markers of neuronal dysfunction including amyloid beta, 
      neurofilament light, neurogranin, total tau, and p-T181-tau were all 
      significantly increased in the nEVs of all participants recovering from COVID-19 
      compared to historic controls. This study suggests ongoing peripheral and 
      neuroinflammation after COVID-19 infection that may influence neurological 
      sequelae by altering nEV proteins. Individuals recovering from COVID-19 may have 
      occult neural damage while those with demonstrative neurological symptoms 
      additionally had more severe infection. Longitudinal studies to monitor plasma 
      biomarkers and nEV cargo are warranted to assess persistent neurodegeneration and 
      systemic effects.

AB  - We describe three cases of critical acute myositis with myocarditis occurring 
      within 22 days of each other at a single institution, all within 1 month of 
      receiving the initial cycle of the anti-PD-1 drug pembrolizumab. Analysis of T 
      cell receptor repertoires from peripheral blood and tissues revealed a high 
      degree of clonal expansion and public clones between cases, with several T cell 
      clones expanded within the skeletal muscle putatively recognizing viral epitopes. 
      All patients had recently received a COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine prior to 
      treatment and were positive for SARS-CoV2 Spike antibody. In conclusion, we 
      report a series of unusually severe myositis and myocarditis following PD-1 
      blockade and the COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.

TI  - Prevalence of EBV, HHV6, HCMV, HAdV, SARS-CoV-2, and Autoantibodies to Type I 
      Interferon in Sputum from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome 
      Patients.

AB  - An exhausted antiviral immune response is observed in myalgic 
      encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and post-SARS-CoV-2 syndrome, 
      also termed long COVID. In this study, potential mechanisms behind this 
      exhaustion were investigated. First, the viral load of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), 
      human adenovirus (HAdV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human herpesvirus 6 
      (HHV6), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 
      determined in sputum samples (n = 29) derived from ME/CFS patients (n = 13), 
      healthy controls (n = 10), elderly healthy controls (n = 4), and immunosuppressed 
      controls (n = 2). Secondly, autoantibodies (autoAbs) to type I interferon (IFN-I) 
      in sputum were analyzed to possibly explain impaired viral immunity. We found 
      that ME/CFS patients released EBV at a significantly higher level compared to 
      controls (p = 0.0256). HHV6 was present in ~50% of all participants at the same 
      level. HAdV was detected in two cases with immunosuppression and severe ME/CFS, 
      respectively. HCMV and SARS-CoV-2 were found only in immunosuppressed controls. 
      Notably, anti-IFN-I autoAbs in ME/CFS and controls did not differ, except in a 
      severe ME/CFS case showing an increased level. We conclude that ME/CFS patients, 
      compared to controls, have a significantly higher load of EBV. IFN-I autoAbs 
      cannot explain IFN-I dysfunction, with the possible exception of severe cases, 
      also reported in severe SARS-CoV-2. We forward that additional mechanisms, such 
      as the viral evasion of IFN-I effect via the degradation of IFN-receptors, may be 
      present in ME/CFS, which demands further studies.

TI  - Immune system adaptation during gender-affirming testosterone treatment.
PG  - 155-164
LID - 10.1038/s41586-024-07789-z [doi]
AB  - Infectious, inflammatory and autoimmune conditions present differently in males 
      and females. SARS-CoV-2 infection in naive males is associated with increased 
      risk of death, whereas females are at increased risk of long COVID(1), similar to 
      observations in other infections(2). Females respond more strongly to vaccines, 
      and adverse reactions are more frequent(3), like most autoimmune diseases(4). 
      Immunological sex differences stem from genetic, hormonal and behavioural 
      factors(5) but their relative importance is only partially understood(6-8). In 
      individuals assigned female sex at birth and undergoing gender-affirming 
      testosterone therapy (trans men), hormone concentrations change markedly but the 
      immunological consequences are poorly understood. Here we performed longitudinal 
      systems-level analyses in 23 trans men and found that testosterone modulates a 
      cross-regulated axis between type-I interferon and tumour necrosis factor. This 
      is mediated by functional attenuation of type-I interferon responses in both 
      plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes. Conversely, testosterone potentiates 
      monocyte responses leading to increased tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6 and 
      interleukin-15 production and downstream activation of nuclear factor kappa 
      B-regulated genes and potentiation of interferon-γ responses, primarily in 
      natural killer cells. These findings in trans men are corroborated by 
      sex-divergent responses in public datasets and illustrate the dynamic regulation 
      of human immunity by sex hormones, with implications for the health of 
      individuals undergoing hormone therapy and our understanding of sex-divergent 
      immune responses in cisgender individuals.

AB  - Since the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2)/coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, global sequencing 
      efforts have led in the field of inborn errors of immunity, and inspired 
      particularly by previous research on life-threatening influenza, they have 
      revealed that known and novel inborn errors affecting type I interferon immunity 
      underlie critical COVID-19 in up to 5% of cases. In addition, neutralizing 
      autoantibodies against type I interferons have been identified in up to 20% of 
      patients with critical COVID-19 who are older than 80 years and 20% of fatal 
      cases, with a higher prevalence in men and individuals older than 70 years. Also, 
      inborn errors impairing regulation of type I interferon responses and RNA 
      degradation have been found as causes of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in 
      children, a life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition complicating otherwise 
      mild initial SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and young adults. Better 
      understanding of these immunologic mechanisms can aid in designing treatments for 
      severe COVID-19, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, long COVID, and 
      neuro-COVID.

AB  - Pathogen encounter can result in epigenetic remodeling that shapes disease caused 
      by heterologous pathogens. Here, we examined innate immune memory in the context 
      of commonly circulating respiratory viruses. Single-cell analyses of 
      airway-resident immune cells in a disease-relevant murine model of SARS-CoV-2 
      recovery revealed epigenetic reprogramming in alveolar macrophages following 
      infection. Post-COVID-19 human monocytes exhibited similar epigenetic signatures. 
      In airway-resident macrophages, past SARS-CoV-2 infection increased activity of 
      type I interferon (IFN-I)-related transcription factors and epigenetic poising of 
      antiviral genes. Viral pattern recognition and canonical IFN-I signaling were 
      required for the establishment of this innate immune memory and augmented 
      secondary antiviral responses. Antiviral innate immune memory mounted by 
      airway-resident macrophages post-SARS-CoV-2 was necessary and sufficient to 
      ameliorate secondary disease caused by influenza A virus and curtailed 
      hyperinflammatory dysregulation and mortality. Our findings provide insights into 
      antiviral innate immune memory in the airway that may facilitate the development 
      of broadly effective therapeutic strategies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to investigate changes in TNF-related 
      apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and gamma interferon-induced protein 10 (IP-10) 
      after COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women and to explore their association 
      with neutralizing antibody (Nab) inhibition. METHODS: The study evaluated 93 
      pregnant women who had previously received two (n=21), three (n=55) or four 
      (n=17) doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Also we evaluated maternal blood samples that 
      were collected during childbirth. The levels of TRAIL, IP-10 and Nab inhibition 
      were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). RESULTS AND 
      DISCUSSION: Our study revealed four-dose group resulted in lower TRAIL levels 
      when compared to the two-dose and three-dose groups (4.78 vs. 16.07 vs. 21.61 
      pg/ml, p = 0.014). The two-dose group had reduced IP-10 levels than the 
      three-dose cohort (111.49 vs. 147.89 pg/ml, p=0.013), with no significant 
      variation compared to the four-dose group. In addition, the four-dose group 
      showed stronger Nab inhibition against specific strains (BA.2 and BA.5) than the 
      three-dose group. A positive correlation was observed between TRAIL and IP-10 in 
      the two-dose group, while this relationship was not found in other dose groups or 
      between TRAIL/IP-10 and Nab inhibition. As the doses of the COVID-19 vaccine 
      increase, the levels of TRAIL and IP-10 generally increase, only by the fourth 
      dose, the group previously vaccinated with AZD1222 showed lower TRAIL but higher 
      IP-10. Despite these changes, more doses of the vaccine consistently reinforced 
      Nab inhibition, apparently without any relation to TRAIL and IP-10 levels. The 
      variation may indicate the induction of immunological memory in vaccinated 
      mothers, which justifies further research in the future.

AB  - Here, we report a case of atopic dermatitis (AD) in a patient who received 
      biweekly doses of dupilumab, an antibody against the IL-4 receptor α chain 
      (IL-4Rα). Single cell RNA-sequencing showed that naïve B cells expressed the 
      highest levels of IL4R compared to other B cell subpopulations. Compared to 
      controls, the dupilumab-treated patient exhibited diminished percentages of 
      IL4R+IGHD+ naïve B cells and down-regulation of IL4R, FCER2 (CD23), and IGHD. 
      Dupilumab treatment resulted in upregulation of genes associated with apoptosis 
      and inhibition of B cell receptor signaling and down-regulation of class-switch 
      and memory B cell development genes. The dupilumab-treated patient exhibited a 
      rapid decline in COVID-19 anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibodies 
      between 4 and 8 and 11 months post COVID-19 vaccination. Our data suggest that 
      intact and persistent IL-4 signaling is necessary for maintaining robust survival 
      and development of naïve B cells, and maintaining a long term vaccine response.

TI  - Effect of Fucoidan on the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm) of Leukocytes 
      from Patients with Active COVID-19 and Subjects That Recovered from SARS-CoV-2 
      Infection.
LID - 10.3390/md20020099 [doi]
LID - 99
AB  - Fucoidan is a polysaccharide obtained from marine brown algae, with 
      anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and immune-enhancing properties, thus, fucoidan 
      may be used as an alternative treatment (complementary to prescribed medical 
      therapy) for COVID-19 recovery. This work aimed to determine the ex-vivo effects 
      of treatment with fucoidan (20 µg/mL) on mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm, 
      using a cationic cyanine dye, 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC(6)(3)) on 
      human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HPBMC) isolated from healthy control 
      (HC) subjects, COVID-19 patients (C-19), and subjects that recently recovered 
      from COVID-19 (R1, 40 ± 13 days after infection). In addition, ex-vivo treatment 
      with fucoidan (20 and 50 µg/mL) was evaluated on ΔΨm loss induced by carbonyl 
      cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, 150 µM) in HPBMC isolated from healthy 
      subjects (H) and recovered subjects at 11 months post-COVID-19 (R2, 335 ± 20 days 
      after infection). Data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces HPBMC loss of 
      ΔΨm, even 11 months after infection, however, fucoidan promotes recovery of ΔΨm 
      in PBMCs from COVID-19 recovered subjects. Therefore, fucoidan may be a potential 
      treatment to diminish long-term sequelae from COVID-19, using mitochondria as a 
      therapeutic target for the recovery of cellular homeostasis.

AB  - Post-COVID-19 interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a new entity that frequently 
      causes pulmonary fibrosis and can become chronic. We performed a single-center 
      parallel-group open-label pilot randomized clinical trial to investigate the 
      efficacy and safety of cyclosporine A (CsA) in the development of ILD in the 
      medium term among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were 
      randomized 1:1 to receive CsA plus standard of care or standard of care alone. 
      The primary composite outcome was the percentage of patients without ILD 3 months 
      after diagnosis of pneumonia and not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation 
      (IMV) (response without requiring IMV). The key secondary composite outcomes were 
      the percentage of patients who achieve a response requiring IMV or irrespective 
      of the need for IMV, and adverse events. A total of 33 patients received at least 
      one dose of CsA plus standard of care (n = 17) or standard of care alone 
      (n = 16). No differences were found between the groups in the percentage of 
      patients who achieved a response without requiring IMV or a response requiring 
      IMV. A higher percentage of patients achieved a response irrespective of the need 
      for IMV in the CsA plus standard of care group although the RR was almost 
      significant 2.833 (95% CI, 0.908-8.840; p = 0.057). No differences were found 
      between the groups for adverse events. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19 
      pneumonia, we were unable to demonstrate that CsA achieved a significant effect 
      in preventing the development of ILD. (EU Clinical Trials Register; EudraCT

TI  - Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Therapy in Patients with Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency: 
      Perspectives from a Registry Study and Practical Considerations for 
      Self-Administration During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 2983-2996
LID - 10.2147/COPD.S325211 [doi]
AB  - Alpha 1 Antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a hereditary condition characterized by 
      low serum Alpha 1 Antitrypsin (AAT) levels and a predisposition towards 
      early-onset emphysema. Infusion of AAT is the only disease-modifying therapy that 
      can sufficiently raise plasma AAT levels above the putative protective threshold 
      and reduce the decline in lung density loss. Several randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) and registry studies support the clinical efficacy of AAT therapy in 
      slowing the progression of AATD-related emphysema and improving survival 
      outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted physicians to develop additional 
      strategies for delivering AAT therapy, which are not only more convenient for the 
      patient, but are "COVID-19 friendly", thereby reducing the risk of exposing these 
      vulnerable patients. Intravenous (IV) self-administration of AAT therapy is 
      likely to be beneficial in certain subgroups of patients with AATD and can remove 
      the need for weekly hospital visits, thereby improving independence and 
      well-being. Increasing the awareness of self-administration in AATD through the 
      development of formal guidelines and training programs is required among both 
      physicians and patients and will play an essential role, especially 
      post-COVID-19, in encouraging physicians to consider self-administration for AATD 
      in suitable patients. This review summarizes the benefits of AAT therapy on the 
      clinical endpoints of mortality and quality of life (QoL) and discusses the 
      benefits of self-administration therapy compared with conventional therapy 
      administered by a healthcare professional. In addition, this review highlights 
      the challenges of providing AAT therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 
      potential considerations for its implementation thereafter.

TI  - Inflammation in the COVID-19 airway is due to inhibition of CFTR signaling by the 
      SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
PG  - 16895

LID - 16895
AB  - SARS-CoV-2-contributes to sickness and death in COVID-19 patients partly by 
      inducing a hyper-proinflammatory immune response in the host airway. This 
      hyper-proinflammatory state involves activation of signaling by NFκB, and 
      unexpectedly, ENaC, the epithelial sodium channel. Post-infection inflammation 
      may also contribute to "Long COVID"/PASC. Enhanced signaling by NFκB and ENaC 
      also marks the airway of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, a life-limiting 
      proinflammatory genetic disease due to inactivating mutations in the CFTR gene. 
      We therefore hypothesized that inflammation in the COVID-19 airway might 
      similarly be due to inhibition of CFTR signaling by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and 
      therefore activation of both NFκB and ENaC signaling. We used western blot and 
      electrophysiological techniques, and an organoid model of normal airway 
      epithelia, differentiated on an air-liquid-interface (ALI). We found that CFTR 
      protein expression and CFTR cAMP-activated chloride channel activity were lost 
      when the model epithelium was exposed to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. As 
      hypothesized, the absence of CFTR led to activation of both TNFα/NFκB signaling 
      and α and γ ENaC. We had previously shown that the cardiac glycoside drugs 
      digoxin, digitoxin and ouabain blocked interaction of spike protein and ACE2. 
      Consistently, addition of 30 nM concentrations of the cardiac glycoside drugs, 
      prevented loss of both CFTR protein and CFTR channel activity. ACE2 and CFTR were 
      found to co-immunoprecipitate in both basal cells and differentiated epithelia. 
      Thus spike-dependent CFTR loss might involve ACE2 as a bridge between Spike and 
      CFTR. In addition, spike exposure to the epithelia resulted in failure of 
      endosomal recycling to return CFTR to the plasma membrane. Thus, failure of CFTR 
      recovery from endosomal recycling might be a mechanism for spike-dependent loss 
      of CFTR. Finally, we found that authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection induced loss 
      of CFTR protein, which was rescued by the cardiac glycoside drugs digitoxin and 
      ouabain. Based on experiments with this organoid model of small airway epithelia, 
      and comparisons with 16HBE14o- and other cell types expressing normal CFTR, we 
      predict that inflammation in the COVID-19 airway may be mediated by inhibition of 
      CFTR signaling by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thus inducing a cystic 
      fibrosis-like clinical phenotype. To our knowledge this is the first time 
      COVID-19 airway inflammation has been experimentally traced in normal subjects to 
      a contribution from SARS-CoV-2 spike-dependent inhibition of CFTR signaling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with impaired 
      endothelial and vascular function. We investigated whether intervention with 
      glycocalyx dietary supplement (GDS), containing glucosamine sulfate and fucoidan, 
      improves endothelial glycocalyx and vascular function after COVID-19 infection. 
      METHODS: Fifty-seven convalescent patients 14 days after mild-to-moderate 
      COVID-19 infection managed in an outpatient setting were randomized to receive 
      GDS (n = 29) or placebo (n = 28) for 4 consecutive months. We measured at 
      baseline and at 4 months: (a) perfused boundary region (PBR) of the sublingual 
      microvessels with a diameter range of 4-25 μm, as a marker of endothelial 
      glycocalyx integrity, (b) pulse wave velocity and augmentation index, (c) 
      coronary flow reserve using Doppler echocardiography, and (d) malondialdehyde and 
      protein carbonyls as oxidative stress markers. RESULTS: Four months after 
      treatment, patients who received GDS showed a greater reduction in PBR 4-25 μm 
      (-6.8% vs. -1.3%), pulse wave velocity (-13.2% vs. -3%), augmentation index 
      (-28.5% vs. -2.5%), malondialdehyde (-26% vs. -2.9%), protein carbonyls (-31.3% 
      vs. -1%) and a greater increase in coronary flow reserve (12.9% vs. 1.6%) 
      compared to placebo (p < .05). In the GDS group, the reduction in PBR 4-25 μm was 
      associated with the corresponding decrease in pulse wave velocity (r = .31, 
      p = .047), malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyls, as well as with the increase 
      in coronary flow reserve (r = -.59, p = .008) at follow-up. Post-treatment, none 
      of the patients under GDS reported post-COVID symptoms compared to 21.4% of the 
      patients under placebo. CONCLUSION: Four-month treatment with GDS may improve 
      endothelial glycocalyx and vascular function after COVID-19 infection. CLINICAL

TI  - Antiviral and Anti-Inflammatory Therapeutic Effect of RAGE-Ig Protein against 
      Multiple SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern Demonstrated in K18-hACE2 Mouse and 
      Syrian Golden Hamster Models.
PG  - 576-585
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2300392 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) continue to evolve and reemerge with 
      chronic inflammatory long COVID sequelae, necessitating the development of 
      anti-inflammatory therapeutic molecules. Therapeutic effects of the receptor for 
      advanced glycation end products (RAGE) were reported in many inflammatory 
      diseases. However, a therapeutic effect of RAGE in COVID-19 has not been 
      reported. In the present study, we investigated whether and how the RAGE-Ig 
      fusion protein would have an antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapeutic effect 
      in the COVID-19 system. The protective therapeutic effect of RAGE-Ig was 
      determined in vivo in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice and Syrian golden hamsters 
      infected with six VOCs of SARS-CoV-2. The underlying antiviral mechanism of 
      RAGE-Ig was determined in vitro in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung epithelial 
      cells (BEAS-2B). Following treatment of K18-hACE2 mice and hamsters infected with 
      various SARS-CoV-2 VOCs with RAGE-Ig, we demonstrated (1) significant 
      dose-dependent protection (i.e., greater survival, less weight loss, lower virus 
      replication in the lungs); (2) a reduction of inflammatory macrophages 
      (F4/80+/Ly6C+) and neutrophils (CD11b+/Ly6G+) infiltrating the infected lungs; 
      (3) a RAGE-Ig dose-dependent increase in the expression of type I IFNs (IFN-α and 
      IFN-β) and type III IFN (IFNλ2) and a decrease in the inflammatory cytokines 
      (IL-6 and IL-8) in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung epithelial cells; and (4) a 
      dose-dependent decrease in the expression of CD64 (FcgR1) on monocytes and lung 
      epithelial cells from symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Our preclinical findings 
      revealed type I and III IFN-mediated antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapeutic 
      effects of RAGE-Ig protein against COVID-19 caused by multiple SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.

TI  - Rituximab in the COVID-19 era: The impact of albumin and IgG on patients with 
      immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.
PG  - 3753-3764
LID - 10.1007/s10067-025-07598-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with COVID-19 outcomes in patients 
      with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) treated with rituximab (RTX) 
      and determine candidates for RTX administration/maintenance. METHODS: We 
      conducted a case-control study of RTX-treated IMID patients with COVID-19 (May 
      2021-April 2023), including 32 hospitalized cases and 64 non-hospitalized 
      controls matched by age, sex, IMID diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to 
      analyze pre-COVID biochemical markers within 3-months and RTX-specific factors. 
      Secondary outcomes in hospitalized cases included COVID-19 severity, viral 
      shedding, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Higher RTX exposure was associated 
      with reduced glucocorticoid dependence and higher pre-COVID albumin levels while 
      correlated with lower IgG levels. However, lower pre-COVID albumin (OR: 0.231, 
      p = 0.012) and higher maintenance glucocorticoid use (OR: 1.170, p = 0.007) were 
      independently associated with hospitalization, regardless of IgG levels or RTX 
      exposure. Among hospitalized cases, lower admission albumin (albumin_D(0); OR: 
      0.029, p = 0.014) predicted severe COVID-19. Patients with 
      albumin_D(0) < 3.45 g/dL had higher mortality, regardless of IgG_D(0) or RTX 
      timing, and experienced prolonged viral shedding despite antiviral mono-therapy. 
      Albumin_D(0) ≥ 3.45 g/dL and IgG_D(0) ≥ 687 mg/dL were associated with the lowest 
      mortality risk. Timing of the last RTX dose did not influence secondary outcomes. 
      CONCLUSION: Pre-COVID albumin and glucocorticoid dependence are independently 
      associated with hospitalization regardless of RTX-specific factors. Admission 
      albumin predicts secondary outcomes. Risk of rituximab on COVID-19 outcomes is 
      not universal. Albumin ≥ 3.45 g/dL and IgG ≥ 687 mg/dL identify lower-risk 
      patients, providing guidance for safer RTX administration. Key Points • Risk of 
      rituximab on COVID-19 outcomes in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases is not 
      universal. Serum albumin and IgG levels are critical to determine the COVID-19 
      outcomes. • Patients with serum albumin ≥ 3.45 g/dL and IgG ≥ 687 mg/dL 
      demonstrate a lower risk associated with rituximab, providing guidance for its 
      safer administration in the post-COVID-19 era amidst potential challenges from 
      emerging infections. • Serum albumin serves as a significant prognostic marker 
      for COVID-19 outcomes in patients receiving rituximab treatment. • The timing of 
      the most recent rituximab infusion does not affect COVID-19 outcomes in these 
      patients.

TI  - Factors influencing mortality in COVID-19-associated mucormycosis: The 
      international ID-IRI study.
LID - myae064 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/mmy/myae064 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), triggered a global pandemic. Concurrently, reports of 
      mucormycosis cases surged, particularly during the second wave in India. This 
      study aims to investigate mortality factors in COVID-19-associated mucormycosis 
      (CAM) cases, exploring clinical, demographic, and therapeutic variables across 
      mostly Asian and partly African countries. A retrospective, cross-sectional 
      analysis of CAM patients from 22 medical centers across eight countries was 
      conducted, focusing on the first 3 months post-COVID-19 diagnosis. Data collected 
      through the ID-IRI included demographics, comorbidities, treatments, and 
      outcomes. A total of 162 CAM patients were included. The mean age was 
      54.29 ± 13.04 years, with 54% male. Diabetes mellitus (85%) was prevalent, and 
      91% had rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis. Surgical debridement was performed 
      in 84% of the cases. Mortality was 39%, with advanced age (hazard ratio [HR] = 
      1.06, [P < .001]), rituximab use (HR = 21.2, P = .05), and diabetic ketoacidosis 
      (HR = 3.58, P = .009) identified as risk factors. The mortality risk increases by 
      approximately 5.6% for each additional year of age. Surgical debridement based on 
      organ involvement correlated with higher survival (HR = 8.81, P < .001). The 
      utilization of rituximab and diabetic ketoacidosis, along with advancing age, has 
      been associated with an increased risk of mortality in CAM patients. A 
      combination of antifungal treatment and surgical intervention has demonstrated a 
      substantial improvement in survival outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Increasing awareness of the high frequency, wide spectrum and 
      disabling nature of symptoms that can persist following COVID-19 infection has 
      prompted the investigation of management strategies. Our study aims to determine 
      the effectiveness of atorvastatin on cognitive function, physical activity, mood, 
      health-related quality of life and features of neurovascular impairment and 
      neuroinflammation in adults with ongoing neurological symptoms after COVID-19 
      infection. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The STatin TReatment for COVID-19 to Optimise 
      NeuroloGical recovERy study is an ongoing international, investigator-initiated 
      and conducted, multicentre, prospective, randomised, open label, blinded endpoint 
      trial with fixed time points for outcome assessments. A total of 410 participants 
      with long covid neurological symptoms were planned to be randomly assigned to 
      either the intervention group to receive 40 mg atorvastatin for 12 months or to a 
      control group of no treatment, on top of usual care. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: 
      This study protocol was designed, implemented and reported, in accordance with 
      the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical 
      Practice, the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, the 
      National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research and with the ethical 
      principles laid down in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. 
      Central ethics committee approval was obtained from Sydney Local Health District 
      Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Ethics (No: X21-0113 and 2021/ETH00777 10) in 
      Australia. Site-specific ethics committee approvals were obtained elsewhere 
      before any local study activities. All participants provided written informed 
      consent. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The study protocol is registered at 
      Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04904536).

      recovered COVID-19 patients.

AB  - COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which induces a 
      high release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, leading to severe 
      systemic disorders. Further, evidence has shown that recovered COVID-19 patients 
      still have some symptoms and disorders from COVID-19. Physical exercise can have 
      many health benefits. It is known to be a potent regulator of the immune system, 
      which includes frequency, intensity, duration, and supervised by a professional. 
      Given the confinement and social isolation or hospitalization of COVID-19 
      patients, the population became sedentary or opted for physical exercise at home, 
      assuming the guarantee of the beneficial effects of physical exercise and 
      reducing exposure to SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a 
      supervised exercise protocol and a home-based unsupervised exercise protocol on 
      chemokine and cytokine serum levels in recovered COVID-19 patients. This study 
      was a prospective, parallel, two-arm clinical trial. Twenty-four patients who had 
      moderate to severe COVID-19 concluded the intervention protocols of this study. 
      Participants were submitted to either supervised exercise protocol at the 
      Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Pernambuco or home-based 
      unsupervised exercise for 12 weeks. We analyzed serum levels of chemokines 
      (CXCL8/IL-8, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL9/MIG, CCL2/MCP-1, and CXCL10/IP-10) and cytokines 
      (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, TNF-α, and IFN-γ). Before the interventions, no 
      significant differences were observed in the serum levels of chemokines and 
      cytokines between the supervised and home-based unsupervised exercise groups. The 
      CXCL8/IL-8 (p = 0.04), CCL2/MCP-1 (p = 0.03), and IFN-γ (p = 0.004) levels 
      decreased after 12 weeks of supervised exercise. In parallel, an increase in IL-2 
      (p = 0.02), IL-6 (p = 0.03), IL-4 (p = 0.006), and IL-10 (p = 0.04) was observed 
      after the supervised protocol compared to pre-intervention levels. No significant 
      differences in all the chemokines and cytokines were found after 12 weeks of the 
      home-based unsupervised exercise protocol. Given the results, the present study 
      observed that supervised exercise was able to modulate the immune response in 
      individuals with post-COVID-19, suggesting that supervised exercise can mitigate 
      the inflammatory process associated with COVID-19 and its disorders. CLINICAL

      intimately involved in the fibrogenic process. When activated, TGF-β promotes the 
      differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and regulates the remodeling 
      of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In this sense, the present study evaluated the 
      histopathological features and immunohistochemical biomarkers (ACE-2, AKT-1, 
      Caveolin-1, CD44v6, IL-4, MMP-9, α-SMA, Sphingosine-1, and TGF-β1 tissue 
      expression) involved in the TGF-β1 signaling pathways and pulmonary fibrosis. The 
      study consisted of 24 paraffin lung samples from patients who died of COVID-19 
      (COVID-19 group), compared to 10 lung samples from patients who died of H1N1pdm09 
      (H1N1 group) and 11 lung samples from patients who died of different causes, with 
      no lung injury (CONTROL group). In addition to the presence of alveolar septal 
      fibrosis, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was found to be significantly increased 
      in the COVID-19 group, associated with a higher density of Collagen I (mature) 
      and III (immature). There was also a significant increase observed in the 
      immunoexpression of tissue biomarkers ACE-2, AKT-1, CD44v6, IL-4, MMP-9, α-SMA, 
      Sphingosine-1, and TGF-β1 in the COVID-19 group. A significantly lower expression 
      of Caveolin-1 was also found in this group. The results suggest the participation 
      of TGF-β pathways in the development process of pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, it 
      would be plausible to consider therapy with TGF-β inhibitors in those patients 
      recovered from COVID-19 to mitigate a possible development of pulmonary fibrosis 
      and its consequences for post-COVID-19 life quality.

TI  - COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, but not a viral vector-based vaccine, promotes 
      neutralizing anti-type I interferon autoantibody production in a small group of 
      healthy individuals.
PG  - e29137
LID - 10.1002/jmv.29137 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are highly effective but also induce 
      adverse events, in particular, autoimmunity. Findings from several studies 
      revealed that patients with life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 infection had increased, 
      pre-existing, neutralizing antibodies against type I interferons (IFNs). However, 
      whether COVID-19 vaccination induces the anti-type I IFN antibody remains 
      unclear. In the current study, we evaluated plasma levels of 103 autoantibodies 
      against various human self-antigens and 16 antibodies against viral antigens in 
      healthy individuals pre- and post-COVID-19 vaccination. Twelve participants 
      received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), and 8 participants 
      received a viral vector-based vaccine (Janssen). All participants produced 
      increased antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 antigens following vaccination. 
      Among the 103 autoantibodies, only plasma levels of IgG autoantibodies against 
      type I IFNs increased in participants who received a mRNA vaccine (3/12), but not 
      in those who received the viral vector-based vaccine (0/8) at postvaccination 
      compared to pre-vaccination. Among the three individuals showing increased 
      anti-IFN IgG following vaccination, both plasma samples and plasma-purified total 
      IgGs showed a dose-dependent binding ability to IFN-α; two of the three showed 
      neutralizing activity to IFN-α-2a-induced phosphorated STAT1 responses in human 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells postvaccination compared to baseline in vitro. 
      Among the 103 autoantibodies tested, the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, but not the viral 
      vector-based vaccine, specifically induced neutralizing anti-type I IFN 
      autoantibodies in a small group of healthy individuals (~10%). Findings from this 
      study imply that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines may suppress IFN-mediated innate immunity 
      and impair immune defense through induced autoimmunity in some healthy 
      individuals, who may need to switch to another type of COVID-19 vaccine (e.g., a 
      viral vector-based vaccine).

TI  - Pirfenidone in post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis (FIBRO-COVID): a phase 2 
      randomised clinical trial.
LID - 10.1183/13993003.02249-2024 [doi]
LID - 2402249
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with severe COVID-19 may develop lung fibrosis. Pirfenidone 
      is an anti-fibrotic drug approved for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The efficacy 
      and safety of pirfenidone in patients with fibrotic interstitial lung changes 
      after recovery from severe COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. METHODS: This was a 
      phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Spanish multicentre clinical trial. 
      Patients were randomised to receive pirfenidone or placebo (2:1) for 24 weeks. 
      The primary end-point was the proportion of patients that improved, considered 
      when percentage change in forced vital capacity (FVC) was ≥10% and/or any 
      reduction in the fibrotic score on chest high-resolution computed tomography 
      (HRCT). Secondary end-points included health-related quality of life (HRQoL), 
      exercise capacity and drug safety profile. RESULTS: From 119 eligible patients, 
      113 were randomised and 103 were analysed (pirfenidone n=69 and placebo n=34). 
      Most patients were male (73.5%) and were receiving low-dose prednisone; mean age 
      was 63.7 years and mean body mass index was 29 kg·m(-2). The percentage of 
      patients that improved was similar in the pirfenidone and placebo groups (79.7% 
      versus 82.3%, respectively). The mean predicted FVC increased by 12.74±20.6% with 
      pirfenidone and 4.35±22.3% with placebo (p=0.071), and the HRCT (%) fibrotic 
      score decreased by 5.44±3.69% with pirfenidone and 2.57±2.59% with placebo 
      (p=0.52). Clinically meaningful improvement in HRQoL was not statistically 
      different (55.2% in the pirfenidone group and 39.4% in the placebo group). 
      Exercise capacity, adverse events and hospitalisations were similar between 
      groups. No deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The overall improvements in lung 
      function and HRCT fibrotic score after 6 months with pirfenidone were not 
      significantly different than with placebo.

TI  - Genetic, Clinical, Epidemiological, and Immunological Profiling of IgG Response 
      Duration after SARS-CoV-2 Infection.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25168740 [doi]
LID - 8740
AB  - The IgG response against SARS-CoV-2 infection can persist for over six months 
      (long response; LR). However, among 30% of those infected, the duration can be as 
      short as three months or less (short response; SR). The present study assembled 
      serological data on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG response duration of two previous 
      studies and integrated these results with the plasmatic cytokine levels and 
      genetic profile of 10 immune-relevant SNPs that were also previously published, 
      along with the plasmatic total IgG, IgA, and IgM levels, allowing for the 
      genetic, clinical, immunological, and epidemiological aspects of the 
      post-COVID-19 IgG response duration to be understood. The SR was associated with 
      previous mild acute COVID-19 and with an SNP (rs2228145) in IL6R related to low 
      gene expression. Additionally, among the SR subgroup, no statistically 
      significant Spearman correlations were observed between the plasma levels of 
      IL-17A and the Th17 regulatory cytokines IFN-γ (rs = 0.2399; p = 0.1043), IL-4 
      (rs = 0.0273; p = 0.8554), and IL-2 (rs = 0.2204; p = 0.1365), while among the LR 
      subgroup, weaker but statistically significant Spearman correlations were 
      observed between the plasma levels of IL-17A and IFN-γ (rs = 0.3873; p = 0.0016), 
      IL-4 (rs = 0.2671; p = 0.0328), and IL-2 (rs = 0.3959; p = 0.0012). These results 
      suggest that the Th17 response mediated by the IL-6 pathway has a role in the 
      prolonged IgG response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - Secondary organising pneumonia associated to COVID-19 infection in patients with 
      central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating diseases treated with anti-CD20 
      therapies.
PG  - 1788-1801
LID - 10.1177/13524585241297038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Organizing pneumonia (OP), an interstitial lung disease, has been 
      observed in patients with inflammatory demyelinating diseases (IDDs) treated with 
      anti-CD20, particularly after COVID-19, but data are limited. AIM: To provide a 
      detailed characterization of COVID-19-associated OP in IDD patients treated with 
      anti-CD20. METHODS: Bi-centric retrospective cohort study including patients with 
      multiple sclerosis (MS), aquaporin-4-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum 
      disorder (AQP4 + NMOSD), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease 
      (MOGAD) who received anti-CD20 and were diagnosed with COVID-19-associated OP 
      between March 2020 and October 2023. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included 
      (mean age 46.8 years; 52.6% female; 63% rituximab, 37% ocrelizumab). Sixteen had 
      MS, two MOGAD, and one AQP4 + NMOSD. Intermittent fever was the predominant 
      symptom. Hospitalization occurred in all but one patient, without fatalities. 
      Chest CT consistently showed OP patterns. Thirteen patients had positive severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR in bronchoalveolar 
      lavage. Treatments included corticosteroids, antivirals, monoclonal antibodies, 
      and convalescent plasma. Fourteen patients postponed infusions; nine resumed 
      post-recovery (median 11.9 months), two switched due to hypogammaglobulinemia, 
      and three stopped. After a mean follow-up of 1.5 years, lung abnormalities and 
      clinical manifestations resolved in 18 patients; however, 13 experienced 
      long-COVID. CONCLUSIONS: In anti-CD20-treated patients with recurrent fever and 
      distinctive CT features, COVID-19-associated OP should be considered.

TI  - Atorvastatin versus Placebo in ICU Patients with COVID-19: Ninety-day Results of 
      the INSPIRATION-S Trial.
PG  - 723-733
LID - 10.1055/a-2059-4844 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND:  In the INSPIRATION-S trial, atorvastatin versus placebo was 
      associated with a nonsignificant 16% reduction in 30-day composite of 
      venous/arterial thrombosis or death in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with 
      COVID-19. Thrombo-inflammatory response in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      may last beyond the first 30 days. METHODS:  This article reports the effects of 
      atorvastatin 20 mg daily versus placebo on 90-day clinical and functional 
      outcomes from INSPIRATION-S, a double-blind multicenter randomized trial of adult 
      ICU patients with COVID-19. The main outcome for this prespecified study was a 
      composite of adjudicated venous/arterial thrombosis, treatment with 
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or all-cause mortality. Functional 
      status was assessed with the Post-COVID-19 Functional Scale. RESULTS:  In the 
      primary analysis, 587 patients were included (age: 57 [Q1-Q3: 45-68] years; 44% 
      women). By 90-day follow-up, the main outcome occurred in 96 (33.1%) patients 
      assigned to atorvastatin and 113 (38.0%) assigned to placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 
      0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60-1.05, p = 0.11). Atorvastatin in 
      patients who presented within 7 days of symptom onset was associated with reduced 
      90-day hazard for the main outcome (HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.42-0.86, p 
      (interaction) = 0.02). Atorvastatin use was associated with improved 90-day 
      functional status, although the upper bound CI crossed 1.0 (OR(ordinal): 0.64, 
      95% CI: 0.41-1.01, p = 0.05). CONCLUSION:  Atorvastatin 20 mg compared with 
      placebo did not significantly reduce the 90-day composite of death, treatment 
      with ECMO, or venous/arterial thrombosis. However, the point estimates do not 
      exclude a potential clinically meaningful treatment effect, especially among 
      patients who presented within 7 days of symptom onset (NCT04486508).

TI  - Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19: Equity-related analyses 
      and update on evidence.
PG  - CD014963
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD014963.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD014963
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID-19 
      because they counter hyper-inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a 
      slight benefit on mortality. Nonetheless, size of effect, optimal therapy 
      regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors 
      that remain to be evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether and at which doses 
      systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with 
      COVID-19, to explore equity-related aspects in subgroup analyses, and to keep up 
      to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review 
      approach. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which 
      includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), 
      Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO 
      COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and 
      ongoing studies to 6 January 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised 
      controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with 
      COVID-19. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids and the 
      following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus 
      standard care, different types, doses and timings (early versus late) of 
      corticosteroids. We excluded corticosteroids in combination with other active 
      substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and 
      corticosteroids for long-COVID treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We 
      followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included 
      studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the 
      certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 
      all-cause mortality up to 30 and 120 days, discharged alive (clinical 
      improvement), new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death (clinical 
      worsening), serious adverse events, adverse events, hospital-acquired infections, 
      and invasive fungal infections. MAIN RESULTS: We included 16 RCTs in 9549 
      participants, of whom 8271 (87%) originated from high-income countries. A total 
      of 4532 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority 
      received dexamethasone (n = 3766). These studies included participants mostly 
      older than 50 years and male. We also identified 42 ongoing and 23 completed 
      studies lacking published results or relevant information on the study design. 
      Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic 
      COVID-19 Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care 
      plus/minus placebo We included 11 RCTs (8019 participants), one of which did not 
      report any of our pre-specified outcomes and thus our analyses included outcome 
      data from 10 studies. Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care compared to 
      standard care probably reduce all-cause mortality (up to 30 days) slightly (risk 
      ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 0.97; 7898 participants; 
      estimated absolute effect: 274 deaths per 1000 people not receiving systemic 
      corticosteroids compared to 246 deaths per 1000 people receiving the intervention 
      (95% CI 230 to 265 per 1000 people); moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence 
      is very uncertain about the effect on all-cause mortality (up to 120 days) (RR 
      0.74, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.34; 485 participants). The chance of clinical improvement 
      (discharged alive at day 28) may slightly increase (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.11; 
      6786 participants; low-certainty evidence) while the risk of clinical worsening 
      (new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death) may slightly decrease (RR 
      0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01; 5586 participants; low-certainty evidence). For 
      serious adverse events (two RCTs, 678 participants), adverse events (three RCTs, 
      447 participants), hospital-acquired infections (four RCTs, 598 participants), 
      and invasive fungal infections (one study, 64 participants), we did not perform 
      any analyses beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics due to very 
      low-certainty evidence (high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and 
      underreporting). Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids 
      We identified one RCT (86 participants) comparing methylprednisolone to 
      dexamethasone, thus the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of 
      methylprednisolone on all-cause mortality (up to 30 days) (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.24 
      to 1.07; 86 participants). None of the other outcomes of interest were reported 
      in this study. We included four RCTs (1383 participants) comparing high-dose 
      dexamethasone (12 mg or higher) to low-dose dexamethasone (6 mg to 8 mg). 
      High-dose dexamethasone compared to low-dose dexamethasone may reduce all-cause 
      mortality (up to 30 days) (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.04; 1269 participants; 
      low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of 
      high-dose dexamethasone on all-cause mortality (up to 120 days) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 
      0.79 to 1.08; 1383 participants) and it may have little or no impact on clinical 
      improvement (discharged alive at 28 days) (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.09; 200 
      participants; low-certainty evidence). Studies did not report data on clinical 
      worsening (new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death). For serious 
      adverse events, adverse events, hospital-acquired infections, and invasive fungal 
      infections, we did not perform analyses beyond the presentation of descriptive 
      statistics due to very low-certainty evidence. We could not identify studies for 
      comparisons of different timing and systemic corticosteroids versus other active 
      substances. Equity-related subgroup analyses We conducted the following subgroup 
      analyses to explore equity-related factors: sex, age (&lt; 70 years; ≥ 70 years), 
      ethnicity (Black, Asian or other versus White versus unknown) and place of 
      residence (high-income versus low- and middle-income countries). Except for age 
      and ethnicity, no evidence for differences could be identified. For all-cause 
      mortality up to 30 days, participants younger than 70 years seemed to benefit 
      from systemic corticosteroids in comparison to those aged 70 years and older. The 
      few participants from a Black, Asian, or other minority ethnic group showed a 
      larger estimated effect than the many White participants. Outpatients with 
      asymptomatic or mild disease There are no studies published in populations with 
      asymptomatic infection or mild disease. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Systemic 
      corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all-cause mortality up to 30 days in 
      people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID-19, while the evidence is very 
      uncertain about the effect on all-cause mortality up to 120 days. For younger 
      people (under 70 years of age) there was a potential advantage, as well as for 
      Black, Asian, or people of a minority ethnic group; further subgroup analyses 
      showed no relevant effects. Evidence related to the most effective type, dose, or 
      timing of systemic corticosteroids remains immature. Currently, there is no 
      evidence on asymptomatic or mild disease (non-hospitalised participants). Due to 
      the low to very low certainty of the current evidence, we cannot assess safety 
      adequately to rule out harmful effects of the treatment, therefore there is an 
      urgent need for good-quality safety data. Findings of equity-related subgroup 
      analyses should be interpreted with caution because of their explorative nature, 
      low precision, and missing data. We identified 42 ongoing and 23 completed 
      studies lacking published results or relevant information on the study design, 
      suggesting there may be possible changes of the effect estimates and certainty of 
      the evidence in the future.
