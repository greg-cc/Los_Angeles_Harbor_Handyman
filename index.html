      <h4>Welcome to Gregs </h4>
      <h4>Pennisula and Harbor Handyman Services website</h4>
      <p>I have been living in the harbor area and working as a handyman   since childhood and have carried out a vast range of home improvement   projects; from furniture assembly right up to installing new timber   decks, pouring concrete, remodeling basement suites and full bathroom   renovations. My goal as a self employed handyman is to achieve and   maintain a high level of customer satisfaction. I strive to become the   best at what I do and maintain a great reputation with my customers. I   cover the Harbor and Penninsula areas. <br>
